Reminds me of 'Documentary reveals the man behind the SOS letter from China’s notorious Masanjia labour camp':,C
"The SOS was hidden in a tombstone. It was a pretend grave marker, made of Styrofoam and purchased at a Kmart an ocean away from where the desperate message had been written. It sat in its box in a storage shed in Damascus, Ore., for about two years, until Julie Keith dug it out in the fall of 2012 for her daughter’s birthday party, which the then-almost-five-year-old requested be Halloween-themed. Out fell a note, handwritten in English and Chinese.",L
"“Sir: If you occassionally (sic) buy this product, please kindly resend this letter to the World Human Right Organization,” began the letter, written from a Chinese forced-labour camp. “Thousands people here who are under the persicution (sic) of the Chinese Communist Party Government will thank and remember you forever.”",L
"So as a broader trend, this type of thing isn't exactly new.",L

A real political priority going forward should be strengthening the Sherman anti-trust act.,C
"This is all part of making America great again. The ""Greatest Generation"" was the one that fought in World War 2. In order to get to that, first we have to allow massive and corrupt consolidation of political power and money during a phase of rapid growth, followed by an unregulated and poorly responded to fiscal crash. This should happen along side the US becoming isolationist, allowing the global political climate to become more and more polarized while our enemies consolidate power. Bam, in no time we can have a depression followed by massive world war to drag us back out of it.",C

The country did so because they were expected to pay massive reparations to the victors.,L
Also because we stopped being able to loan them money due to the Depression. The US was sending Germany truckloads of cash to help them pay their reparations (which Britain and France then used to pay off money we'd loaned them during the war...),C
"Man, the 20th century was a great time to be a United States Government.",C
The country did so because they were expected to pay massive reparations to the victors.,L
Paying to the victors of the previous war they started? Or at the very least Wikipedia says that Germany made the first overt declaration of war.,C
"Yes, those ones. I'm not saying Germany had no responsibility for the damage, I'm saying it's unreal to expect them to pay for it, and that it was a contributing factor to the rise of of the Nazis and eventually WW2.",C

It's just continuous little things that, each one by them selves is bad... but not HITLER bad... but then you add them all up, and it's just the slowly increasing heat of the water as you boil a frog.",C
I didn't say we haven't done anything wrong. I only pointed out that there are a few more countries deserving of the title of Nazi Germany 2.0,L
"No one deserves it quite yet. With time and distance I think people underestimate how truly terrible the Nazi regime was. Sure, China is getting there, but I think they had a head start on us. Give us time, we can be number 1!!!",L

"The Nazi machine was terrible, and a good way to set your ""Evil"" scale at evil. That doesn't mean that we weren't doing horrific things during WWII. The internment camps for Japanese was a massive violation of human rights. Look up how we treated Nazi war criminals compared to our own citizens. Then there was the non-consensual medical tests being done on African-American citizens. Dropping the Atomic Bomb is another example - though it has been argued as being for the better good, it was one of the worst attacks against civilians to that date.",C
"So - ISIS is a terrible thing, but would WWIII be against them? Russia and China have terrible human rights records, but if we compare ours to theirs - were do we stand? We have the highest rate of incarceration in the developed world, combined with a very racially biased judicial system. We have had three presidents in a row who have condoned torture in various ways, the latest has condoned extrajudicial executions by a green beret. Then there is the tear gassing of migrant children across international borders, the detainment and separation of children from their parents with no plan or mechanism to reunite them, and the detainment facilities that don't do background check on unqualified workers caring for children in the middle of the desert without adequate resources - one of which is referred to as ""the freezer"" because its so cold.",C
"I understand society requires certain moral compromises to exist, and there will always be these moral fights to have between whats easy and what is right. However, this country, time and time again, seems to be choosing what is easy. As politicians slip to populism, an increasingly divided public slips into bad combination of apathy and anger that will either be or undoing or turning us into, as you put it, the ""baddies"". We won't wake up one day with Swastikas on our jackets and think ""what happened!"" - no it happens slowly, with inaction after inaction, justification after justification until you don't even remember that your world used to be a very different place.",L
"Dropping the Atomic Bomb is another example - though it has been argued as being for the better good, it was one of the worst attacks against civilians to that date.",L
"Worst singular attack. However the firebombing of Japan from 1944-1945 is estimated to have killed 300,000-500,000 civilians as opposed to the 120,000 killed from atomic bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima.",C
"I don't have a source on it but i believe someone in command at the time said ""We better win this war, or we'll be charged with war-crimes.""",C
"There was long term health effects from the atomic bomb. MANY people survived the two atomic bombs and really wished they hadn't. So yes, more people have died in a couple of other attacks (I don't want to look it up) and some were more grotesque - but when you add the two together, I would argue the atomic bomb was the worst.",L
"It doesn't really matter though, if you're in the list of top ten, it's gonna be pretty bad. So, not saying I disagree with you - it's a value system that's subjective - so I'll end this comment by saying ""good point- war is hell""",C

"Look at the midterm election results - there is basically no question the president has surrounded himself with self-dealing corrupt staff who will do anything to keep Trump in power, including nominating a supreme court justice who threw a tantrum during his job interview. Congress and Senate are not standing up to Trump, and while inroads were made, basically half to the US has said ""this is fine.""",L
"Unless some amazing leader, who can have broad appeal and bring both sides together, while winning a national election against populists, emerges out of the ether - I see democrats ripping each other apart in the primaries then limping into battle against a energized Trump. Best case scenario a populist is nominated and wins the presidency... but then not having the back bone to effect real change, since populism is not a way to lead a country.",L
An amazing leader that everyone loves and does the impossible?,L
Sounds like a real Antichrist fellow.,C

"Not really sure who you're directing this at - but if you read through some of my responses you'll see that my biggest concern about the US is the polarization. Yeah, things look back, but it's mostly apathy and anger that the extremist politicians are playing on. Vote for people who are actually informed, challenge lies, don't put up with negative ads, and vote for people willing to compromise and see both sides.",C
"This bullshit runs rampant because it's what gets people elected. The Senate should have flipped this november if we were actually engaged informed citizens. So, channel that anger away from hate and towards educating yourself so you can slowly nudge people on the fence towards reason.",C
A world war that has weapons unlike any other?? Trust the process? When nuclear weapons are launched all over the world what makes anyone think that there will be any govt. left to “take us out of it”. I am by no means discounting your opinion I’m just wondering how the logic works..,C
"It was meant to be a sarcastic skewering of Trump's policies and election slogan. I am not actually advocating for a WWIII just to make us ""great"" again.",L
"I'd also argue, post WWII america was extremely problematic as that was the midst of the civil rights fight... and the wrong side of it at that point. The racist housing policies that went into place in the 40s that brought stable wealth to so many white Americans and was denied to so many African-American veterans still paints our landscape today. So our ""greatest"" generation was just as problematic as any one before it or after.",C

"I think that is partially true. Fox is cutting alot of fat and only wanted to hang on to assets that are steady sources of revenue.

"I saw a fight on the nyc subway the other day. A woman started gouging this other woman’s face and attacking her. A lot of people told her to stop, no one physically stopped her though. The victim’s boyfriend started yelling and getting up to protect her, but then thats when another guy stepped in to tell him to sit down. It was a short attack but the victim’s face was pouring blood. Some bystanders gave her tissues to help clean her face and stop the bleeding.",C
"Other bystanders starting telling the attacker off which was good. And she went off on them, threatening them and getting in their faces too. One guy in particular sat in front of her and was telling her off about how stupid she was and acting stupid. But when she got in his face, a lot of other people were telling him to chill and that he cant hit a woman. I could hear conversations going on things “cant hit a woman”, “shes starting it and get in everyones faces”.",C
"Respect to the bystanders that spoke up, because this lady was attacking them verbally too. Respect to the guy who made it a point to tell that lady off.  I was too much a pussy to do anything so im not saying anything about the ‘bystander effect’. But the fact that more people were willing to step in when it became a guy simply yelling at the woman then when the woman gouged another woman’s face up is messed up.",L

Woman puncher here:,C
"had a homeless couple try to mug me and my girlfriend in Atlanta when I was a young in shape college football player. At first it was almost comical, the guy grabbed my arm and told me to give him my wallet, I had about 6 inches and probably 80 lbs on him so grabbed his Arm back and slung him to the curb. I'll never forget how limp his arm was, just skin and bone, no muscle at all so he went further and harder than I thought and hit the pavement really hard, I was actually worried I had really hurt him... Until his girlfriend pulled a knife and came after me, it was just your typical restaurant steak knife but since I didn't feel like getting hepatitis that day I just straight up punched her in the face.",L
"Side punch to the temple, down for the count.",C
"Her boyfriend ran away yelling I was a bitch for hitting a woman. I called the cops who got there just as she was waking up, cop advised me to just leave because if I filed a report she would probably try to sue me, they booked her on possession of some meth she had on her. I hope she got the help she needed but I didn't feel like getting cut because of some weird social issue.",C
My girlfriend would go on to tell everyone I was a woman puncher and I'd have to beg her to please append that with the actual story.,L
"I guess from context (you don't say 'ex-girlfriend') it was sort of a cute teasing thing where you didn't have to beg her that much, right? Because 'she was about to stab us' is a big detail.",C
"Lol yes , totally teasing like for weeks after she'd introduce me as ""girl puncher"" before explaining.",C
She's an ex but we are still friends,C
She’s afraid not to be! /jk,L
Man I love this story but it still pisses me off so bad that you had to leave the scene for “fear of getting sued”. Glad you and your girlfriend were ok!,C
"The best part of this story is your opening line.  IMO I would never hit a woman, unless she made the first move.  If she pulls out a knife or punches me in the face, you best believe I am gonna punch her back.  Or at the very least restrain her if she is really small.",C
i wonder why the boyfriend intervened so late. also the second guy who stood up to intervene because the boyfriend wanted to defend his gf is such a dumbfucking shit brainwashed asshole. it irritates me beyond belief.,L

Yea the whole “never hit a woman thing” gets thrown out of the window if I see you gouging out somebody’s face like a lunatic.,L
I actually have a short story.,L
"I was at the bus stop at my school and at the intersection there was a collision that happened while I was waiting.  My first instinct was to make sure everyone was ok but as I got close to the car I saw people around me pulling out their phones recording.  I got upset and screamed at a guy to call 911, I should not have yelled at the poor guy but it did bother me.  Fortunately everyone was ok and by some crazy coincidence there were some forest rangers passing by and they handled the situation immediately.  I feel as of I see at least one person recording for safety measures then that's completely fine but when the majority of people are doing it then I see it as in issue, but that's my take from it.",C
"One thing that is taught in First Response lessons is that if you witness an emergency like someone collapsing, before you even start performing CPR or anything, you pick one random bystander, point at them and tell them to call 911.",C
Singling one person out increases the likelihood of them springing into action instead of being frozen by bystander syndrome.,L
"You whats your name? Good ""insert name"" I need you to call 911 and relay what I tell you. Always try to address them by name. It keeps them focused and from going into shock.",L
What is wrong with people?,C
"Long story short, I got jumped at a public bus stop mid day with 20+ people standing around. Everyone had their phone out, nobody called the cops. Bus came and the guy got on and rode away...",C
Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche and Ricky John Best we’re stabbed to death on a light trail train in Portland Oregon. They were trying to intervene with a man yelling anti Muslim stuff at two women. When they stepped in to intervene the crazy guy pulled a knife and slit their throats.,C
Plus that guy Best was ex military and still got killed. Nothing is a guarantee.,C
"There's a thing called the Bystander Effect - the more people around who COULD help, the less each individual feels the need to assist. If someone falls over on a crowded street, people assume someone else will help if they don't, but if there's only a few other people around, they feel an obligation to check on things because 'no one else is around', etc.",L
"I know, and the practice of going against the bystander effect is specifically called bystander intervention!",L
but there is still the reasonable regard for personal safety to be considered. bystanders should act but i can see why people wouldn't want to risk serious injury,L
And honestly even he didn’t do a great job. He kept letting that chick get hits in instead of actually standing in between them. And there were a handful of other people who did absolutely nothing. Drives me insane.,L
The same woman was arrested for using mase on the subway. I’ll pass.,L
"This is a good article with a lot of details on her. Lawyer, $110k/yr practice but not taking cases the last decade, lives in public housing. Arrested more than twice for similar stuff. Warrants on her. LegalAid somehow comes to her rescue each time. Weird story. Worked for a bunch of Russian law firms and specializes in immigration law and personal injury - wonder if she just helps Russians with insurance scams and wants to pull one off herself.",C

In the other thread they were saying this is most likely money laundering. I’m curious what happens to her.,C
"Yeah, my gut tells me there's a lot to this and her employers. I couldn't find her name on the NY attorney registry (nycourts.gov). Her other specialty is personal injury. Probably a whole lot of shady shit going on with those law offices she worked for. Wonder how many car insurance injury cases they've done. Just waiting for someone to deck her, I'd bet.",L

"Having met a few disbarred lawyers before, it seems like every lawyer that gets disbarred either loses it after being disbarred or had some serious shit going on to catch the bar’s attention.",C
"From what I understand, it's very hard to actually get disbarred. Suspensions and fines are much more commonly utilized. I believe the only sure-fire way to get disbarred is to be convicted of a felony.",L
Fuck with your clients money. That will get you suspended or disbarred really fast.,L
Mine was disbarred for stealing the car accident settlement money he was supposed to be holding for me when I was a minor.,L
That and stealing the money a guy was awarded for being disabled due to a brain injury when he was hit by a train. That poor guy was near-vegetative and spent the rest of his life in a crappy state-paid care center.,C
He should get prison for that,L
I’m guessing he did?,L
I can’t remember. I was just so happy he’d been disbarred at the time because he’d been allowed to continue practicing for 10 more years after he was initially caught.,L
"Absolutely.  If you read the disbarments section, it's usually fucking with client's money.  One lawyer that I know of was running a private practice and taking the money out of the IOLTA account before he had earned it. (Which, for non-lawyers reading, is a HUGE no-no.  You can only take out of the retainer fee what you have undoubtedly earned.  Any contested amounts must be kept in the account until the disagreement over it is settled.  Any remainder of the fee that remains unearned after the work is finished goes back to the client).",L
"He bought himself a house in the better part of town and got himself a brand new SUV.  Everyone was curious how he was managing to buy these things so quickly and easily.  I mean, he was doing well but not new house and new SUV in the same year well.",L
"Next thing you hear about with him, he's being disbarred because someone pointed out he had never given back the unearned portion of the retainer fees after his work as their attorney was over.  He had done this to multiple clients.  He kept telling them, ""Oh, I sent the check, did you not get it?"" Or ""Must have gotten lost in the mail.""",L
His clients reported him for it after months of being yanked around before one of them realized he didn't have the rest of their unearned fees.,C
"Now, he's disbarred for an ethical violation that he created and no one has that much sympathy for him.",L
Boggles my mind why people do this stuff. So much work goes into getting your law degree only to throw it away for usually ends up not being that much $$.,L
I just found out  the opposing counsel on one of my cases suspended - the suspension was for failing to provide docs to the grievance committee but (I'm guessing because there are no such documents to help in his defense) he apparently wasn't giving his clients their settlement money.,L
Commingling funds is  a good way to get the boot,L
"My best friend got disbarred because he fell into opiate addiction and ghosted some clients. Sadly, he ghosted me too from that point. Been like 5 years :(",L
The NY Bar doesn’t mess around. If they get a complaint or you’re accused of commingling funds or any sort of other misconduct they will summon you in immediately and you better be able to provide records and documentation explaining what happened or you run the risk of suspension and disbarment. They bring the hammer down hard.,L
"A friend of mine was disbarred after a huge spat with his brother, another fairly well known lawyer. Only after a few months did his brother pass away, then the hardships we're even worse for him when he started getting involved with some local dealers and other shady folk. He did get his credentials back only about a year later, but I don't think it helped much. He became a 'criminal' lawyer if you know what I mean... The last I heard he was in hiding after getting pretty involved with some of the Cartel working in the states down south. Blows my mind how much impact a small setback can have on a person.",C

He was also interviewed on CNN.,C
"I don't watch CNN.  These days for TV news I tend to just stick with PBS Nightly News.  It's better for my mental health that way and cable news seems to be 5% news, 95% entertainment.",L
"Agree. Tune into some shows for the top of the hour rundown of the latest developments, but the second the opinion panels start it turns into straight garbage. And too many shows seem like they're exclusively opinion panels because I am not willing to sit through that to see if there are any investigative reports they're gonna show.",C
And too many shows seem like they're exclusively opinion panels because I am not willing to sit through that to see if there are any investigative reports they're gonna show.,C
"Exactly.  News reporters are supposed to report the news.  I want to be read and shown the news, I do not want to be told what to think about the news.  I wish all the news channels and shows would get rid of the opinion panels and just go back to reporting the news.  I can think for myself and form opinions without FOX/CNN/NBC/SINCLAIR providing assistance, thank you very much.",L
"We only have PBS News left because federal law requires that PBS report the news without opinions or bias.  Everytime I hear Republicans in the Senate threatening to dissolve PBS because they irrationally project ""liberal bias"" onto PBS for reporting the news with zero bias... I am filled with dread.",L
"I agree with you on that lol. I was searching for more on the story and read an article on it on CNN and saw they'd posted a video of their interview with the dude. CNN aesthetic is weird these days, it's almost like they're on an advanced ESPN set. As I don't live stateside anymore I stick with the good ol BBC world news myself for my news  (though the Brexit story is getting really tiresome).",L
it's almost like they're on an advanced ESPN set.,L
"That is intentional.  Six years ago they brought in a new CEO.  That CEO is Jeff Zucker that has an education and background that isn't in ""journalism"" but ""entertainment"".  He decided that to improve CNN's ratings and viewer engagement, the network needed to reformat all of CNN's content to be more like ESPN Sports Center.  I guess the investors figured this was a good idea because Fox News had changed what Americans thought of as proper ""news"" and they wanted to regain ratings (profits) with viewers.  Vox did a good break down on the changes he made and how they changed CNN.",C

Saturation of Attorneys? To high expectations of getting 200k a year after 150k of student debts? ( from crappy schools),L
"Lawyers have extremely high rates of addiction, depression, and general mental health issues. They have terrible work life balance and have very stressful jobs. That doesn’t make this woman’s case any less weird, just in general being a lawyer is pretty overrated.",C
Also even when you consider the amount of money they make they still have to pay rent/mortgage in New York City.,L
"I was going to say, 110k/yr in NY is not great. At least not what I'd expect an experienced lawyer to make in that kind of market.",L
"Yeah I dated a lawyer who seemed bipolar. Thought it would be good, she was rich and attractive, but once she started having her weird mood swings and arguing about everything I knew it was time to get out.",L
"I'm guessing law also attracts certain personalities that might be at greater risk for mental health issues, as I imagine you need to be borderline sociopath/psychopath (confident, relatively well spoken, intelligent, competitive, manipulative, etc.) to be a good lawyer.",L
"Jeez- whTs up with these lawyers, esp in NY?",L
They seem to be frustrated as fuck,L
"Being a lawyer in this day in age, especially in NYC is horrible. The field is completely flooded due to the assumption that Lawyer's always make a lot of money, and because of the college's lying about job oppourtunities.",C
"A law school in NY actually got sued over the fact that they completely lied to incoming students about the likelyhood they would get a job out of school. They said that 90% plus students got a job right out of school, but neglected to mention most of them did not get jobs as lawyers.",C
How come she’s not disbarred yet from her previous arrest? Will she get disbarred for this incident?,C
"Because being arrested is not the same thing as being convicted. Also, in New York, a violation or misdemeanor does not automatically result in disbarment, but a felony conviction would.",L
Sometimes the judge orders you to coach a peewee hockey team.,L

"People in NYC arent that violent either. Times have changed, it's actually one of the safest cities to be in. People are rude though, there is this strong irony that speaking out and being loud for a bump demanding respect on a crowded train is the polite thing to do. They will even threaten you for it, but i've never seen a fight break out of it even though i see that every day.",C
"She was decked, to the floor, twice. Watch the video.",C
"Eh I think a lot of these comments are really wrong in saying recording is better than intervening. If everyone is just recording & letting the white woman beat the Asian, then what? What about her immediate needs? Should she be beat with the umbrella until she’s braindead for someone to finally step in?",L
"I think it’s a bit ridiculous that I’m seeing a bunch of people say they would just record. Sure. You’re helping her after-the-fact, by you just willingly played into a woman getting beat.",L
"On a train full of people you can do both, so I agree. At the same time no one wants to put their hands on a white woman and then get thrown in jail for it because the cops will probably side with her.",C
I wrestled down a black dude beating up a gay guy once in this city and the cops held me down and started questioning me. I only got off because one guy out of the crowd watching vouched for me. No one wants to be in that situation and cops here aren’t exactly geniuses.,L

"No one wants to catch a charge for giving these wastes of life what they deserve. We have family to care for. I would have definitely had given her an ultimatum though: get off the train on the next stop or face a citizen's arrest while I call the police. I wouldn't have minded too much if I got myself in a bit of trouble potentially. With that said, I'm surprised someone didn't get physical with her. There are plenty of other videos of nutjobs attacking others out of racism with someone on the train later telling them to gtfo or get beat (or at least soup thrown in their face like in one video).",C
"I'm so glad she got nabbed, this video had me incensed.",L

I'm really sorry that happened to you. It's not ok.,C
10 minutes does NOT sound like a short time AT ALL. I was yelled at for something like 60 seconds on a bus several years ago and that was traumatic. 10 minutes with no one intervening to help would have felt like an eternity!

"Even though I believe that every person should protect another person regardless of race or gender, i also understand the sense of community that gets built when you all deal with the same sort of racist shit. As an asian, the racism we receive is just different and sort of under the radar sometimes so it’s important to stand up and be like “not today”",C
"As an asian too, I read a comment that said, ""Almost as bad as saying the N word"". Dude, the word she used is pretty much the ""N word"" but directed at asians. So yeah, I also feel like racism against asians is so casually dismissed by the general population.",C
"asian people are often forgotten as minorities and face racism that other groups don't face, but that doesn't mean we should turn against other minorities. Marginalized gfoups of people need to build solidarity and coalition with each other, not be pitted against each other to preserve inequalities that alrady exist.",L
I'm south Asian.  We deal with it too.  The only time it gets coverage is when people's shops get burnt down or someone is killed.,C
"I'm also Asian. Far too many of us also play into the model minority stereotype because we don't want to cause trouble. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen fellow Asians excuse racist jokes on here. See: the Family Guy bit about how God created Asians; athletes making slant eyes; the Christmas Story Chinese restaurant scene; small penis jokes. Any time these topics come up, Asians on here jump over each other to say it's no big deal. I've been that person myself, and it's shameful.",L
It has to start with us before we start pointing fingers at other minorities.,L
"I always see these jokes mocking Asian accents like “sum ting wong”, and I’m like bro, it’s not even funny, they don’t try to make the joke clever. Those jokes quite literally are just “oh look, he made something normal sound Asian HA HA HA”.",L
The worst is when Asians make fun of Asians to get their white friends to laugh.,L
"Racism towards asians are still by and large okay in hollywood and most of america. But asians shouldnt count on other minorities to care or make others notice. One of the more prominent reason is asians just dont complain enough for people to care. Couple that with a smaller population then we can see why asian jokes are not completely politically incorrect. See chris tuckers bit at the oscars a few years ago during the most racially tense year for the oscar awards. No one batted an eye. If you want things to change, it starts with asians all over america first to take a bigger stance against racism.",C
"Even when the minority is very vocal about it, a lot of people will still not care.",C
"Asians are misrepresented and underrepresented  in plenty of ways I’m not even Asian and I notice this. But to be blunt, you have to be your own advocate in these kinds of issues. You can’t care too much about the idiots who down play issues that don’t effect them but effect you. You have the most credibility when speaking about issues that effect you.",L
"Uhhh, do you mean Chris Rock?",C
We're always left out whenever there's a discourse on race in politics. Just think about the most recent election. How many of those candidates advocated for us or tried to directly campaign their platform to us?,C
I saw this on my local news here in Phoenix before I saw it on Reddit...,L
> assaults woman,L
"A couple of people say ""hey, knock that off"".",L
> calls woman a dirty word,L
Everyone gasps and loses their shit.,L
"What the fuck is wrong with the US, seriously?",L
"Lmao reminds me of that Dave Chapelle stand up bit, ""throwing a snowball at a motherfucker is a misdemeanor assault, but if you call him a ni**er when you do it, that's a felony hate crime""",C
"Yes, I was looking for this comment. Racist slurs are bad, but they're much easier to react to than straight up beating. In the video it looks like no one gives a shit about a person hitting another person with keys and an umbrella, but as soon as something they could be OUTRAGED about came up? Everybody turned into a superhero... If the asian woman called the white woman white trash or something after being beaten up, who would the heroes have lined up with?",L
Oh you beat me to it. Yeah i agree. So fucked up. Racist: bad. Assault: very very very bad imo,C
"Yup, this is the first thing I thought of. Don't get me wrong, people SHOULD respond like that when someone starts using racist slurs, but you should also act much more passionately when people are literally getting kicked and hit with items. Honestly I think part of it is no man wants to get physically involved against a woman. Especially a minority (guy filming sounded black, guy trying to defend her was Asian). Black man getting physical with a white woman in New York will never end well for the black man sadly.",C
This is her second arrest in the subway for racial assault? Damn how racist can you be on the NYC subway of all places.,L
ok serious question to all the internet lawyers here. If you are a bystander and see this happening in front of you and you come to the defense of someone like that Asian victim there are you allowed to use force? i mean one man can end it with one punch to the head and then its over or just one person bear hugging her and holding down till police arrive?,L
"If you go to PlatanoMan’s twitter for the entire three clips (he posted three diff videos to twitter), you’ll see in the very last one, she says some racist things about him and smacks his phone out of his hands and he eventually just pushes her to the ground and holds her there till they get off the train. He then restrains her hands to her back till the police came and arrested her.",C
"So kind of to answer your question, this dude basically “bear hugged her” to the ground and he was thanked/etc by the NYPD twitter page.",L
3rd video is linked somewhere here too. https://heavy.com/news/2018/12/anna-lushchinskaya-2/,L
"Idk why but it annoys me that everyone started yelling at him to stop when he finally takes her down. Like no, don't stop him, y'all should have done the same way before, don't stop the only guy that's actually doing something effective.",L
I wonder if it would have been the same if a woman had been the one to take her down.,L
"Some people are just extremely adversed to violence. Two women kicking at each other might not have reached the limit, but a large man throwing a woman to the ground pushed some (what sounded like female passengers) over the tipping point.",L
"His actions were totally justified imo, but the response of onlookers is probably based on instinct to avoid confrontation.",L
"I think the worry from the other passengers was that he would retaliate and take it too far. Luckily he was smart enough to just pin her to the ground. Some people get angry and just start throwing fists, which would be overboard in this situation.",L
Fucking thank you. Where were all those “no no stop stop” when she smacked his phone out of his hands. Suddenly a chorus appears when someone actually does something to stop the person assaulting people on the train. Infuriating.,L
"I thought it was more they didnt want him to get in trouble. I thought I heard one person saying ""she isn't worth it"" or something like that. I totally wish he had just kept her on the ground until police showed up, but I could see him accidentally getting blamed for something",C
why the hell doesnt anyone have a link of this full video?,C
"It was top of r/publicfreakout last week, lemme check if it's still there",C
"Speedy edit: link to video, the streamable video in the comment is a 'part 2' of that incident.",L
Imagine being so full of hate that you violently lash out at someone because YOU bumped into them.,C
I’ve been violently lashed out on on the subway a couple of times. You can bump into someone on a super crowded train and set them off or sometimes they just don’t like your face. Crazy is as crazy does.,L
I love how they quoted the guy exactly,L
"""What? B****, I'm Dominican!""",C
i can like just hear that exact in my head,L
"This is Lushchinskaya's second arrest this year for a subway altercation -- both took place at the 36th Street Station in Brooklyn. In June, she was arrested for allegedly pepper spraying a man and woman, according to DCPI detective Sophia Mason. Both were Hispanic. She was charged with harassment, menacing with a weapon and attempted assault.",C
Normally she'd have been deported or put in an institute.,C
Nothing new in the plight of human kindness Just another day on the ride.,C
Her eyes are deeply creepy.,L
I will post a racist-pro comment here: SHE IS RUSSIAN.,L
Bullshit article title. A tirade would be if she was just shouting shit; she straight up assaulted and injured that woman.,L
I wonder if they will try and push hate crime charges as well.,C
Doesn’t look like hate crimes was listed as part of her charges according to this article. https://heavy.com/news/2018/12/anna-lushchinskaya-2/,L
"But like, why did everyone suddenly get up in arms when she said a word? Isn’t the physical attack a little more of an issue than a racist slur?",L
She's nucking futs. For real,C
I guess Trump just found a new Chief of Staff candidate,L
Deport the Ruskie bitch,L
"after assaulting and slurring someone, she calls the cops? thats someone who truly believes in a certain privilege.",L
I'm pretty sure I've seen this woman on the F train before in a similar situation. Damn. The black woman she was harassing got off before anything happened though.,C
she tried to attack a dude twice her size and he took her down and held her until she was arrested.,C
Hopefully the fact she makes 110k and got legal aid gets looked into.,C
"I suppose it is because it is the states, but she'd have been grabbed in Canada the moment she tried assaulting anyone. But weapons are probably a real fear I guess.",C
"Been riding the subway (in Los Angeles, yes we have them) for a couple years. I've never seen a man physically attack another man... 100% of the time it's women. Hair pulling, weave yanking, spitting, punching, whipping bags, etc. And their victims are usually other women.",C
The way she desperately tries to look for an opening to edge in to attack the woman. It's amazing just how feral and unhinged it is.,L
"It's amazing how entitled these people are, and how you can tell they're just waiting for an excuse to throw out the racial slur.",L
"This is an entitled woman who's had a persecution complex raging for a while now, and just took her first real chance to lash out.",L
Am I the only one that thinks it’s weird for Heavy to post her home address in the article???,C

What exactly are three middle-aged women supposed to do against two large male violent thugs with guns and the freedom to beat and kill with impunity? Getting involved could in no way help the situation.,L
"And you want them to do what? Physically intervene and escalate an already violent situation? Assault a police officer, which is definitely its own crime? Risk being charged with obstruction by cops who obviously don't have care much for reasonable responses?",L
If they interfere they get beaten/shot themselves.,L
"Interfering with a police officer, no matter the circumstances, is a very very bad idea.",L
"Tell that to the victims in the book Ordinary Men, where the cops voluntary did most of the killing outside of the death camps. Or read about what happened in the middle of the night in Russia during most of the last century in Gulag Archipelago.",L
"“And how we burned in the camps later, thinking: What would things have been like if every Security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive and had to say good-bye to his family? Or if, during periods of mass arrests, as for example in Leningrad, when they arrested a quarter of the entire city, people had not simply sat there in their lairs, paling with terror at every bang of the downstairs door and at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else was at hand?... The Organs would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport and, notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the cursed machine would have ground to a halt! If...if...We didn't love freedom enough. And even more – we had no awareness of the real situation.... We purely and simply deserved everything that happened afterward.”",C
That has nothing to do with an isolated incident of police officers who overreacted to an unruly kid. Get a grasp on reality please!,L

"Only a liter? Man, you're a tough one.",L
Damn.,C
Multiple firearms,L
Kids were adopted,C
Meds involved,C
Sounds like there wasn't a history of calls to the house,C
This didn't happen over a minute or so. This took a bit which is crazy. Unless the kids of varying ages were sleeping in the same room and she carried and loaded multiple weapons between the killings... Yikes.,L
Meds involved,C
Just for clarification diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and melatonin were the meds involved.,C
Benadryl is a deliriant in high doses.,L
I used to work in Saudi and took a shit ton (10ish times the recommended dose) to try and get over the jet lag. It made me see crazy shit. Spiders the size of dogs crawling out of gaps in the walls kind of shit and takes hours to get over.  Super bad high - do not recommend.,L
"Diphenhydramine is one of 3 chemicals which are considered ""true"" hallucinogens, which means it can make you see things which FULLY aren't there, and have no basis in reality. It's a really really intense drug in high doses.",L
"For curious folk, I believe the other two ""true"" hallucinogenic chemicals are Dimethyltriptaline (DMT) and Salvia Dinorum, but I could be mistaken about one of them",C
"Yeah it’s a deliriant, so you are not aware of the fact that it’s not real.  From what I’ve read on erowid most trips are bad. It’s basically like going into full on psychosis for a while",L
Erowid is an amazing resource. Love that site.,L
"Wait, are you saying i can trip on Benadryl?",L
Ive always wanted to try DMT....,C
Brb.....,L
"Edit, That was sarcasm.... But, I still want to try DMT.....",L
"Plenty of people have great experiences on DMT - no one has good experiences on DPH, don't fuck with that shit. Duration is a big factor too, that DPH state of psychosis is gonna last a lot longer than a DMT trip.",L
Is this why some folks mix it with grape soda?,C
There's no indication that there were little kids or that they were given melatonin in the article.,L
by giving them meds,C
You can't really infer that when the coroner specifically said it wasn't found in the autopsies.,L
"They can still be given melatonin, you should just talk to your doctor beforehand just in case.",L
"That's the weird part. Aside from the 17 year old, the other 3 kids were all in bed. Including two who shared a bedroom, one shot 8 times, one shot 4 times. It'll be interesting to see more details as the case opens up.",L
Drugged them.,C
Report said no drugs or alcohol in anyone's systems,C
then how were drugs involved?,C
"Benadryl and melatonin were found in the house. Neither is remotely uncommon, nor is finding them together in a home. Nobody should claim that their presence provides some clue to what happened.",C
"the person we are replying to directly said ""Meds involved""",C
why even mention it if they were just in the house.,L
Because they're trying to imply something.,L
"Same way ""Bath Salts"" were ""involved"" in that Florida man face chewing.",C
"Conclusion with no facts. If you read the story, it said no drugs or alcohol in any of the kids or the mother.",L
"Zzzquil and melatonin may not be considered ""drugs."" They were mentioned as being present and it may be that by ""drugs"" the article means prescription or illegal drugs.",L
I'll never understand cases like this where the kids are adopted.,C
Nobody accidentally adopts a child. Whereas literally half of pregnancies are unwanted.,C
Then they have to go through background checks and whatnot yeah??,C
Makes no sense what goes through some people's minds,L
As someone whos left crippled (phisically) by an abusive mother..... At least there wont be any more suffering now little ones. Im sorry.,C
Mental health is important here. Really sad.,L
"I can't fathom the toll it took on the first responders. She used multiple calibers/firearms and shot them all at least 4 times. Some in their beds. Sometimes reddit isn't good for your mental health, hearing the horrific atrocities like this. Certainly makes me question my faith in humanity.",L
Just try and remember that we read the worst things that happens and that hundreds of millions of people don't do things like this. A miniscule part of humanity do things like this. It's horrible but it's far from normal.,L
Mothers don't have to be mentally ill to harm their children. Some are just really bad people.,L
I think wanting to intentionally harm and/or kill your own child for no reason counts as a major symptom of a mental illness.,L
"If a mother wants to harm her children, by definition she is mentally ill.",C
Not necessarily. source: psych degree,L
me question my faith in humanity.,L
So you're saying shooting your own children is a mental healthy decision?,C
I agree. I’m actually glad people here are sensible and not just calling for magazine restrictions or some BS.,L
Obviously if the children had guns this would never happen,C
Homeschooling your kids is a red flag of someone likely to murder them?,C
He's trying to insinuate anyone who homeschools their children must be doing so because they are somehow crazy/off/whacko/violent/etc.,L
"Remember when you were in primary school and there were always a few ""homeschool"" kids who joined public school like, mid-8th grade? They tended to get shit on and bullied for being different. That user is just doing that, but ostensibly as an adult.",C
Or maybe they are an educator who has seen the social harm done to many kids through homeschooling once they try to enter a real school and don't know how to interact with their peers.,L
Homeschooling is a red flag for a lot of stuff.,C
"It's an anti-social behavior that lends itself easily to teaching anything. Whatever that parent wants to put in the kid's head. Maybe it's geometry, maybe it's a skewed fundamentalist ideology praising violence and intolerance. It's why I don't really support home schooling at all.",L
"That's right! Children are the property of the state. Allowing them to suffer under the misguided tutelage of people who love and care for them is an outrage. They need to be corralled into public schools and domesticated.   All who question authority and defy social convention should be punished. Drill into their maeleable little brains the social virtues of submission and docility, and they will never rise above the mediocrity that is their proper station.",C
"You're right, because without homeschool, parents could never teach their children bad things.",C
Oh wait that's not right. That's silly. That's the word I was thinking of.,C
Here's the difference as I see it. If the kid goes to school they're being socialized with other kids. The experiences they bring from home are checked and challenged by the group. If you pull someone out of the social situations in life you're preventing them from learning some really important skills at the same time you remove their ability to check the information you're feeding them.,L
"It's not that a parent is able to teach a child something, but that they can teach it within a vacuum. That's always the challenge with extremism. Turn on the lights and it calms down, allow it to fester in the shadows and you get consequences. I'm not saying that's what happened with 'Tennessee mom shoots kids', but from what I've seen from home-schooling I'd be real curious to know why they were homeschooled and what they were being taught.",C
If the kid goes to school they're being socialized with other kids.,L
"Homeschools do interschool dances, sports, etc. I played little league baseball with a dozen homeschool kids growing up. Soccer. Basketball too. Saw them in Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, etc. Hell, my sister did pageants and dance recitals with homeschooled kids all the same.",C
"Your experience has led you towards prejudice. I cannot emphasize this enough: When you judge entire groups of people by the few, remote interactions you've had with people like that in the past.. that's prejudice. Period. Nothing more. Just prejudice.",L
"Flipside: I was raised catholic too. Knew lots of catholic kids, virtually all in public schools. I saw the whole ""indoctrinating parent"" thing happen there often enough too. In fact the daughter ended up running away with the school track coach because she was so ready to get away from her parents.",L
"But of course, not all the Catholic kids were like that.",L
I'm not saying that's what happened with 'Tennessee mom shoots kids'..,C
"""I'm not saying, but if it turned out to back up my prejudice then I'd be okay with it"". Unbelievable.",C
"OK, I'm prejudiced about a lot of things. If you went to homeschooling, then yes, I think you're a threat until you prove otherwise. This is the cost of having a system where evil is allowed to fester, I don't like that cost and want to expose the cockroaches to the light.",L
What I'm saying is that homeschooling is a risk and that I don't like tolerating that risk. I want to take the freedom those people have from them to prevent them from homeschooling. I don't think I was really unclear.,L
"Everyone carries prejudice, the question I like to ask is whether the prejudice is justified from past experience. Home school = bigass red flag.",L
At least you're finally willing to admit you're just prejudiced against homeschooled kids. First step is admitting you have a problem after all.,C
"Everyone carries prejudice, that's true. But good people fix their prejudice when it's brought to their attention. They don't double down on it.",L
"You talk about prejudice like it's something bad. Prejudging a situation short circuits the OODA loop of an opfor. If we both have to make a decision about a situation, whoever decides first dictates the next decision point.",C
Prejudging someone for something they can't control is quite different than having expectations as a society. One of the expectations I have for a society is to prevent people from hiding extremists in an education system.,L
OODA loop wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop,C
Video version using IL-2 as a basis for explanation of OODA loop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbyGOd6NwME,C
"OK, I'm prejudiced about a lot of things. If you went to homeschooling, then yes, I think you're a threat until you prove otherwise. This is the cost of having a system where evil is allowed to fester, I don't like that cost and want to expose the cockroaches to the light.",L
Provide one example of any school system where evil cannot fester.,L
What I'm saying is that homeschooling is a risk and that I don't like tolerating that risk. I want to take the freedom those people have from them to prevent them from homeschooling. I don't think I was really unclear.,L
Outright admitting you want to take freedoms away from people because of a risk they may or may not present. This is overzealous because you don't want to tolerate that risk.,L
"I get you don't like extremism, but preventing homeschooling will do nothing to curb extremism.",L
"The way your framing this is strange to, like you want to be some hero exposing all the bad people that homeschool their kids.",L
"I wasn't homeschool, and agree it has it's issues but to say that it should be completely disallowed because of that is absurd.",L
agree it has it's issues,L
But that was my entire opening argument. That it had issues and that it represents a red flag. That's all I said originally.,C
"Calling ""home schooled"" a red flag is pretty insulting to the millions of healthy and happy home schoolers out there. But don't let me stop you from using your prejudice to bring up political issues in light of a horrific tragedy.",L
His statement isn't entirely without merit.,L
"Neither: I just treat people with respect, and not prejudice.",L
Does someone have to be black in order to be against racism? No.,L
Does someone have to be a woman in order to promote feminism? No.,L
Does someone have to have a job in order to be against shitty labor practices? No.,C
"Hey you don't live in Saudi Arabia, guess that means you can't have an opinion on them. Right? No.",L
I mean I just call out prejudice where I see it; fuck me right?,L
"I was home schooled but it was because the public schools where I was at the time were super terrible. I learned more than many of my public school peers, was able to travel far more often (took weekly field trips to Washington DC since we lived about an hour away) and felt far more in control of my own work since I worked through an online system and it tought me how to keep up with everything without an instructor there harping over the shoulder. Still had plenty of friends in the neighborhood so it wasn't like I was some loner with no social skills. Honestly it was great for me at the time. Went to public schools after that for the rest of middle and high school after we moved but I still loved homeschooling.",C
You just seam particularly eager to defend homeschoolers.,L
"That's weird, you seem particularly eager to attack them as a group, or at least defend someone who is. People you've never met, people they've never met.",C
"Which one of us is doing the asshole thing, then? The guy defending strangers or the guy attacking strangers?",C
This is not a difficult concept.,L
"I hear what you're saying and I'm glad you had a good homeschooling experience. I know 3 families that did homeschooling with wildly variable result. Homeschooling is a red flag, no doubt about it. There can be good experiences, but when someone pulls a kid from public school into homeschooling my first thought will always be that they want to shield the child to keep them religious. That's been the majority of the people that I met in highschool that were home schooled beforehand. Complete literal belief in the bible, complete intolerance for non-religious people, complete intolerance for anything they were taught was wrong according to the bible. Like I said, I'm glad you had a good homeschooling experience, and I treat home-schooled people with suspicion and support removing the option to home school.",L
I hear what you're saying and I'm glad you had a good homeschooling experience.,C
I wasn't homeschooled. I simply do not appreciate judging large groups of people with prejudice.,C
"Side note: It's extremely ignorant to assume anyone defending a thing must themselves be that thing. But then, public school, amiright?",C
"I know 3 families that did homeschooling with wildly variable result. Homeschooling is a red flag, no doubt about it.",L
WOW. A sample of three whole families? In the same exact geographic region?,L
"You're right, you're acting out of a wide and varied experience, not prejudice. Case closed, man. /s",C

"It depends on something called ""price elasticity"" of the good or service, which is a measure of how a change in price affects sales. Because for very inelastic goods a change in price doesn't doesn't really effect sales (think pharmaceuticals, gas, water), so in that case what you said is correct; the cost of taxes is mostly passed on to the consumer (because even with a increase in price it won't drastically effect sales). But for elastic goods where a increase in price will cause sales to plummet, the cost is mostly eaten by the business because they would lose more money by raising the price. In reality all goods are neither perfectly elastic or inelastic, so the cost of a tax is split; and by how varies from good to good.",C
"TL;DR: It depends on what's being taxed, because for some goods companies will pay more of the tax, and for others consumers will.",C

"Obviously the way we handle the issue currently isn't working, but I do think there's some validity to the argument that if you just house every homeless person, suddenly there will be a ton of additional homeless people showing up for looking for homes.",L
"Also, it's not going to happen, but we really need a single nationwide policy on fighting homelessness, because currently cities that treat the homeless poorly are rewarded (homeless people leave there), and areas that provide good services to the homeless are inundated with additional homeless people.",L

Million Dollar Murray wouldn't have kicked his drug addiction just because he had an apartment. There's also the question of where these services are going to come from, given the nation-wide psychiatric shortage.",L
"Giving homes to the homeless is part 1 of a very, very long list. Saying ""housing them is cheaper"" ignores the strained charity services who had to come in to pick up the slack in countless ways to make these programs work.",C
"I'll say that while finding homes doesn't solve those problems, it can certainly help. People who have homes can apply for jobs more easily, because they have a fixed address. Homelessness itself can exacerbate and even cause mental illness (among other things, being homeless is extremely stressful), and having a home can at least cut down on those factors. Same with drug abuse, since many homeless people turn to drugs after becoming homeless as a way of coping. It won't cure someone's schizophrenia, sure, but it provides stability, which makes everything after that much easier.",C

"(No, I don't have an unlimited text plan. A lot of people don't.)",L
I honestly didn't know non-unlimited texting plans still existed.,L
Right? There are cell plans for less than $20/month that include unlimited texts. You almost have to go out of your way to get a plan from anyone that doesn't include that.,L
"In Ontario, you can get unlimited texts and calls for $15 a month. Data is much more expensive, though. I'm paying $40 a month because I need the damn data to navigate around the city...",L
Google let's you download maps to your phone so you can still navigate without data.,L
"I'm using buses, so I need the local app for bus routes, etc.",L
"Aren't those usually pretty fixed, though? I used buses a lot in the before times, I just had the printed time tables of the relevant routes. I imagine you could get them in your phone one way or another.",C
"Yes, and that's what I used to do, but it's too stressful for me. With data, I can look up in real-time anything I need. Missing the stop or the bus changing the route (just happened last week, I'm guessing because of construction or something else) is no longer a problem.",C
Mobile data has gotten me out of more than a few binds. It's worth an extra $20/month imo,L
"im on the same plan. $40 is a steal in Ontario, especially with unlimited data. freedom mobile ftw.",L
Chatr here. I no longer have it in me to be outraged about the prices...,L
"its called pay as you go. if you never or rarely use your phone, it costs less than $20. my dad used pay as you go for his whole life. guy is so stingey that his phone dings 10 seconds before a minute is up and he rushes to let you go before 10 seconds pass.",L
At some point it becomes kinda odd to live like that unless it's out of absolute necessity.,C
I guess they don't want to be texted and go out of their way for an excuse to not be texted.,L
"How much are they charging you per text? You might save money telling them to block text messages from your plan entirely, and use data instead.",L
Or switch carriers if you can't live without text messages. Ting charges 0.25 cents (that's a quarter of a penny... $0.0025) per text message. Though they still charge for sent and received.,C
"I still use Tmobile though. I have an unlimited everything plan, and they have pretty good service in my area.",L
Though my bill would probably be half the cost if I switched. I'm still considering it.,C
"My ex-gf and I use to have a plan from 2008 that charged $10 for unlimited text messaging each month. If you didn't pay for that, text messages were $.10 each. So you would have to send 100 text messages each month. We never even hit 100, so I tried convincing her to stop paying $10 a month and start paying for each one. She kept with the $10, easy for her, whatever.",L
"I should also mention that this was back when we had to hit each number in order to get a letter, so no one really texted that much or often. I used T9, but no one seemed to want to even try it. It was so convenient.",L
"Man, there are days when I probably send 50+ text messages.",C
"There needs to be a plan that knows when I'm in a new relationship and gives me unlimited, then slowly scales itself down monthly.",L
"Wtf is that, in France you can't even get not unlimited texts. Literally the cheapest option, that costs 2$/month still has unlimited texts",L
"This is basically the case in the US as well. There are plans with limited texts, but you really have to go looking for one to find them",L
I don't know if this company is available everywhere but I use a service called Tello. It's $12 a month for unlimited talk and text and it offers a decent amount of high speed data for the price. They have even cheaper plans and I think the most expensive plan is around $40 with unlimited high speed data. I was able to use my own SIM card and I've had no issues with the company. Just passing this info along in case it benefits anyone.,C
"Right now they are running a special for $5 for the first month.  The $14 plan has unlimited talk and text and 1gb of data.  But after you go over the 1gb, they don't charge you.  They just bump you down to 2x.",L
The only drawback is that they use Sprint's network.  So you'd need a Sprint compatible phone.,L

Wow that would have been a bad idea.,L
"No, it would have been amazing. Just publish the phone numbers of all the state reps and let every person in the state text them non-stop. Since the tax had no limit on incoming message taxes, you could literally bankrupt somebody legally with spam texts.",L

"the more time I spend away from california, the more I want to just vacation there instead of live there.",L
"The only reason I tolerate the high cost of California is that I live within an hour or 2 of almost any kind of vacation spot anyone could want. I can jog to the ocean after work, or bike to the mountains. I don't have to take 2 weeks off, once year, to do the things I really enjoy. Sure after rent, all I can afford Is an occasional burrito, but as long as I make the most of the natural environment, I'm digging it.",L
I also live in California. The biggest hang up is home ownership. Once you achieve that it's not really much more expensive than other places. Washington DC is more expensive then San Diego and it snows there.,C

My husband’s car was broken into on two different occasions in broad daylight in the parking lot of a Trader Joe’s.

"That's 30 percent right there. Now according to the expense sheets I ran at the time, I was averaging $400 in sales and gas tax a month living in LA which was another 10 % of my take home. So yeah, you're right I was only losing 40% of my pay to taxes in the land of the third highest living expenses in the country. My bad. I now make $40,000 a year more in Philly while paying the same rough dollar amount as I did living in LA.",C
"FICA is actually double that. The other half is paid by your employer, but since it is a direct cost of employment, it really is a tax on the employee.",C
"That 10% could easily be made up with all the taxes you didn't count. Phone fees, waste disposal fees, recycling fees, ""sinners"" taxes, hotel fees, rental car fees. There's a bunch I know I am forgetting or don't know about. I pay easily 50% if you add everything up. And yes, born and raised in CA.",L
"It’s crazy that 50+% of your wages can go to various federal, state, and municipal governments and them still be facing budget deficits. The amount of waste and corruption in government is just ridiculous.",C
"This is true at every level of government; cities/states/the country constantly are implementing tax increases with no expiration or the option to renew the taxes indefinitely for one-time spending. “We need to add lanes to this highway.” Tax hike. several years later ok, highway’s finished, what now? “Well, we could lower those taxes... or we could funnel it back to our payroll/pensions/etc...“ “yeah, let’s do the keeping it thing.” “Now we need to build a new wing on the capital.” “ What about that money from the highway?” “That money’s spent.” We need new money.” On and on, over and over.

Throw in an additional £1531.91py for council tax (property tax). Add in fuel (currently ~$8pg), VAT etc then you are looking at about the same.",L
The US attitude towards taxation seems to be based on having lowered income tax and then trying to make it up piecemeal while also having reduced services vs the tax value.,L
"Tax higher at the start, offer actual services e.g. healthcare and stop chipping it from little things that annoy people.",C
Fuck the people that defend overbearing taxes.,L
The problem isn't just overbearing taxes -- it's that plus not getting a return on your taxes. Many countries have a high tax rate but have amazing benefits for it as the return.,C
"Exactly. BART better be a competitor to Japan's railway system with the taxes that go to it. Instead, we get moving homeless toilets.",L
The taxes that go to Bart are no where near what other developed cities and countries spend. Part of the problem is people not understanding that underfunding causes inefficiency and poor quality.,L
That often costs as much as an Uber,C
"Yes, but keep in mind they dont have ridiculous property taxes like the low income state taxes, and so they kind of cancel one another out.",C
My taxes in Georgia and Kansas were within 2-3% of what they were in California because in Georgia and Kansas they had ridiculous local property taxes and fees for everything that was covered by the state taxes in California.,L
When I lived in Florida my annual property tax was half as much as my mortgage. It was insane.,C
"And most importantly, because it taxes income and not property value, the California system hits the poor, disabled, and retired far far less. If you lose your income or have a sudden drop, your taxes drop as well. Not so with states that rely on property taxes.",C
"The foreclosure rate in California is significantly lower that Texas or Florida because of this. Because your taxes arent based on your home ownership, but your income.",L
So the system is far more fair overall. For that 2-3% additional taxes you get a shitload of additional benefits.,L
"Like a functioning police force that can be called anywhere in the state at any time, including out in the forest. Police who will come help you change your tire in the rain, and who are actually held accountable to the law. You cant say that in many other states.

Aaaand some blacksmithing tutorial videos I've been watching are gone...,L
"Probably because it involved the process to potentially make weapons regardless of the context. I mean we all have a forge and quench tank in our backyard along with all the material and skill needed to properly make pointy metal objects, obviously.",C
I get annoyed with this logic since making a weapon take considerably more effort when a big rock would suffice.,C
Why sword when big rock do trick?,C
thog don’t caare about man modern weapon,C
"See world, oceans, fish, jump, china",C
"When Youtube still allows ""ElsaGate"" content but takes down something as harmless as learning how to smith things, logic literally doesn't apply anymore.",C
"They did the same thing with firearm build videos. It can get very complicated in a hurry, but the videos are there so that if you DO do it, you’re both within the bounds of the law and being safe. Most legal gun owners don’t even do builds, and people that break the law don’t have the patience for it if you can just steal it. Nothing they were doing was illegal, yet even including links for parts caused bans and deleted content.",C
"That was all in the past year, and waddya know, it came full swing on everyone else as well. This isn’t about having any actual morals, this is all PR stuff for maintaining profit.",C
"Bummer, I love falling asleep to some guy pounding out a broadsword in his garage. There's something relaxing about it.",L
Lots of dudes sleep better after pounding out their broadswords.,L
Totally!  I love firing mine to about 1500°F before laying it on the anvil and smashing it with a hammer.  Such a therapeutic activity,L
Which channel?,C
The “YouTube Rewind” thing must’ve hurt.,L
"""Dont like our content huh?""",L
Flexes power,L
"""We dont like yours either""",C
"I legitimately wonder how many of these ""hate videos"" are just videos critical of YouTube's corporate practices, exploitative monetization schemes and censorship tactics.",L
You can be absolutely assured they'll use this opportunity to sweep some actual dirt under the rug.,L
Nobody will jump up and defend content with hate speech. YouTube sugar coats this saying they're removing hateful content via algorithm... Which conveniently picks up all of their critics as well.,L
"""That's not hate speech.""",L
"""Well I hated it!""",C
"I figure it's ""YouTube removes 8 million videos about hate, 20 million videos criticizing them, and 30 million videos to do with neither their bot picked off.""",L
This is likely extremely accurate,C
"I eagerly anticipate the ""HOLY SHIT YOUTUBE NUKED MY CHANNEL"" reports from some legitimate channels.",C
We saw that with mumkey Jones already.,L
"That already happened with Mumkey Jones. He got bombarded with surprise strikes on his channels, and when he made/used backups they got nuked too. All 4 of his channels, gone in a few days.",C
I really REALLY wish YouTube had legit competitors.,C
I love Vimeo as a place to host videos since you pay for the product while with YouTube the individual is the product. You get treated so much better on that platform,L
"Ah, but paying to host your content doesn't really make it a competitor considering people are trying to make money by creating  content.",L
"That's what's weird about YouTube, they only became popular in the first place because they ran without ads. They would never be number one if their first few years they had the same ad policies they have now.",C
In my opinion YouTube gives me Hulu vibes nowadays,L
"Thank god for Adblock, I'd have quit internet without it.",C
uBlock Origin seems to be the most effective adblocker these days.,L
Hard since they operate at a loss,C
"Exactly. Google's big enough that they can develop all of the advertising platforms, the backend, and are probably the only ones capable of creating such a robust and effective content search and discovery algorithm. They are also big enough to swallow the costs since it's integrated well into their company.",L
"Anyone can setup a video hosting platform with subscriptions, comments, voting, etc. But no one can create something that can engage users as well as YouTube.",L
"The competitors would do the same thing, they would have to if they wanted to keep advertisers and not go bankrupt",C
But they won’t remove the “Play GTA V on mobile!” Or “Play COD Black Ops 4 on your iPhone!” spam ads that I keep seeing in my feed that are downright false/misleading even though I keep flagging as inappropriate. It’s literally just the game E3 launch trailer but with embedded links to their spam fake  “review” site.,C
Fucking got something like this today for Overwatch Mobile. Scummy.,C
Blizzard is already planning ahead after the amazing reception to Diablo mobile.,L
Is this an out-of-season April fools joke?,L
"What, don't you have a phone??",C
If only.,L
Hehe. No.,L
"""dO yOu GuYs NoT hAvE pHoNeS?""",C
I get these all the time and I really can't wrap my head around how they exist and why they haven't been shut down.,L
There’s all kinds of cloaking software that allows “blackhat” advertisers to hide the content of their ads in able to go outside the terms and restrictions of whatever ad platform they’re using. Huge on Facebook and Google.,C
"The advertisers accounts are OFTEN being shut down, and I’ve known associates with well over 100 accounts at a time. They pump these spammy ads until they eventually get shut down, make lots of money doing it, and then just reopen new accounts with new credit cards.",L
It’s effective enough to make people a lot of money in the digital marketing industry.,C
Yeah...th last time they did this shit...all my videos were removed and had nothing to do with any of that crap they were all Linux videos!,C
You monster.,L
Serves him right. Don't trust penguins. They're birds that can't fly. Just unnatural.,C
Formal dress yeah okay...but all the time??,L
"Penguins are a symbol of organized crime in Gotham city, do you really want to use an OS associated with a criminal empire?",L
Not flying is also a myth... they just fly in water.,C
Flying is just swimming in the air,C
Boats are just indecisive airplanes.,L
Open source pssh.. more like open..  Remorse?,L
Idk it's too early,L
Open Sores is the running joke.,L
Linux videos,L
Obviously hate speech against us windows and them dumb Maccies,C
It's a true Mac iVellian cycle. Linux users are always against the broken Windows theory.,L
This ban wave brought to you by Windows 10 gang.,L

Fuck off Stallman,L
Fuck off Stallman,L
Just wanted to see it again. He's the best and worst thing to happen to Free Software.,L
Stallman was right.,L
Now do something about those creepy mommy videos. I’m really haunted by that.,L
Example of this? Like what would I type to find this?,L
"Sorry, I just love weird YouTube rabbit holes.",L
"EDIT: Found it all thanks to you guys. And I am going to just go back to my bubble and play old Nintendo games like nothing is wrong. Too much for me, I'm out.",C
"It’s basically a woman doing fetish videos, while playing with her children. It’s brutally disturbing, and I’m shocked YouTube is just like yeah alright.",C
And the channels are fucking verified. By a HUMAN,L
I have three theories on this:,C
These channels had safe videos on them and bots were used to get the subscriber count high enough to get verification. Then once they got the verification they wait a week and started posting the questionable material.,C
The people verifying the channels are underpaid and overworked and need to hit quotas. So alot of shit id sliding under the radar. YouTube could be doing the bare minimum so they can claim the videos are being screened for advertisers.,L
YouTube is lying and no human verification is happening. It's all managed by automation which can catch 90% of the shit but then what were seeing is the last 10%.,C
"Unless they employ hundreds if not thousands of people to screen videos or review reports. This shit will continue to happen. They really need to work with the community to make a better system. Create a system of unapproved moderators, approved moderators, and eventually paid moderators. This way you can get the truly awful material straight to the people who can remove it. I'm sorry to say but automation is not solving this problem. I used to write automated controls for processing checks and no matter how much code I threw at checks I would always have about 10% of them going to the exception queue for human review.",C
"Also, in the ene it's more profitable for YouTube to let this shit slide and ask for forgiveness later.",L
They could employ thousands of people just to screen videos and it still wouldn't be enough to make a dent in the questionable content.,L
Welp time to borrow a page from Tumblr and remove all videos! That'll get rid of the questionable content!,L
Taps temple,L
Can't have any questionable content,L
If we don't have any content,L
That sounds like it could easily be a gateway to child pornography.,L
Well the hula-hoop dancing videos are certainly a gateway.,C
Essentially it's young girls dancing with hula-hoops but the comments are the worst.,L
All the videos titles are in a multitude of different languages (presumably to hide in plain site as the average user is unlikely to click on them),C
Uploaders only reply to english comments.,L
Lots of 'Kik4Kik' and 'Snap4Snap' comments along with .onion links.,C
I don't see what else it could be behind those links.,C
And youtube comments are somehow worse than I realized! I didn't know that was possible.,C
"To be fair, YouTube comments are already as bad as you could get. Go to any WWII video and you'll find half the comments section is people saying ""we fought for the wrong side"" or ""the British bombed civilian German towns eight times before Hitler did"" or ""I don't recognize Paris without all the black people"". It's disgusting, and YouTube doesn't care to lift a finger to remove any antisemitic or racist comments.",C
"Comments on any kind of history video are just fucking riddled with nationalists all the time. It's like the shittier a country is, the prouder the comments about it are, and the louder the flame wars get. Even ancient history stuff, like about groups that don't exist anymore and haven't for thousands of years, ends up with a lot of barely-literate forehead typists trying to claim the groups and cultures for their own countries.",L
"I got a plugin that makes all YT comments read as ""herp derp"" and it's been pretty great.",C
Edit to link to this plugin: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/herp-derp-for-youtube/,C
Or a byproduct human trafficking and forced sex slave labor. The Vietnamese mom and her children in the videos that hit the main page yesterday are almost certainly being forced to perform on camera.,C
"It's absolutely borderline child porn. I'm convinced a lot of these videos are requested, along with the equally creepy asmr and challenge vids, so that pedos can get off on them.",L
The worst is the parents grooming their kids for this shit because they're not the ones buying lighting equipment and semi pro mice and cams.,C
"Personal anecdote:  Daughter and her husband encourages my granddaughter to make ""unboxing"" videos of her Barbies and accessories in skimpy clothing.  I've flagged the videos and tried to talk to them about the troublesome comments, like the ones that are basically timestamps to inappropriate hotspots.  I've tried to tell them, even if they delete them later when she gets older, perverts can still cache them now. Their logic:  ""I dare those sickos to go ahead and come here and try to put their hands on my daughter; they will leave in a body bag!"" while angry chain-smoking cigarettes.  So, basically the tl;dr is:  angry adult children lashing out at the world with YouTube enabling the stirring of the shitpot.",C
This guy does some videos on weird youtube shit.,L
Pay money wubby,C
Pay money wubby  TJ Miller,L
"Common mistake, but I fixed that for you",C
"Edit:  Want to just mention to everyone who liked the video Wubby posted that he doesn't make his money off YouTube at all, his money comes from his Twitch streams and to visit that site to support him in his endeavors, he very much deserves it!",L
Fat TJ Miller,C
Double fixed,C
Didn't this guy do a video in EslaGate too? I think that's the first time I'd heard about it. Good for him for bringing this up.,L
"Not only is wubby damn funny, he is right and this is deeply concerning. Also, monetized and verified - wtf.",C
"It's close to pedo territory, basically an Asian milf in various scenes playing with her very young children while doing various upskirt poses, and breastfeeding her child so she can show her nips.  It's softcore,but what makes it super creepy is there are children crawling around her while she's posing to give the cameraman a good view of her underwear",C
"Don't tell me, it has like 30 million subscribers and the channel owner uses a different supercar for each day of the week.",L
https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/a6v0ef/creepy_mom_videos_need_to_stop/,C
SuSu Family,L
Wubby is that you,L
Yet they have done nothing to remove pervy videos aimed at children.,C
"Dude. Every time I put on Sesame Street for my kid YouTube always ends up putting on those, obviously predatory, “toy channels” and videos of creepy guys in costumes doing non kid friendly stuff. Some videos feature Spider-Man stabbing Hulk to death, and super heroes trying to gang rape Elsa. Pisses me of so much these people make millions of dollars off this shit and YouTube will do nothing because $$$$$$$",C
"EDIT: wow, so many parenting experts here. I totally forgot I had free will and could choose not to use YouTube. Thanks!",L
"Whoa that’s fucked. I’ve never heard of this, can you hit me up with a link? I believe you but I got to see this with my own eyes",C
r/ElsaGate,C
I just looked at this and had no idea it was a thing. Scary shit.,C
"It's still going strong. Whenever my kid is allowed to use youtube, I have to hover over her shoulder. No matter how many of those videos I nix, another one gets recommended right at the top.",C
"Absolute garbage trash, zero value to my kid. And it just does not go away. I've removed hundreds of those videos by now but they keep coming.",L
At this point it makes more sense to whitelist videos rather than blocking all you see,C
This has been requested over and over and over by parents all over the world. Google is vehemently opposed because they want their recommendation algo to keep you glued to Youtube.,L
Google are assholes. Peppa Pig getting dismembered by an escalator? No problem! Have $100k in ad revenue!,L
Play 1 second of music in the background somewhere in a 5 hour livestream? Demonetized,C
Peppa Pig getting dismembered by an escalator.,L
"To be fair, are we sure fed up parents aren't driving the views on this one?",C
"Nah, that would be Caillou",C
At this point it makes more sense to whitelist videos rather than blocking all you see,C
"YouTube currently doesn't allow this, so what I did was get a nice big micro SD card and put it in my kids tablets and downloaded a couple of dozen videos that they enjoy watching and then turned off the Damned internet.",C
Now they can watch their videos on drawing and making and doing things and we can change them out whenever they want but they don't have access to just start blindly going through videos and coming across this crap.,L
"Youtube is really creepy. There was another series recently released where youtube was promoting videos with hot moms getting semi-naked and 'showing you how to breastfeed', or play with their kids in their panties, as part of the kid friendly programming series. There is a serious amount of deminented brainwashing going on, targeted at busy parents and perverts who masturbate to little children, and mothers who use them for sexual advantage.",C
"Google back in the day (1998) use to have something called google video. This was straight up porn, anything goes. The idea was that by not regulating, people would learn to police themselves. Now youtube has turned into this weird space where you cannot say anything anti-government, but you can masterbate on children.",L
It's like the most totalitarian brainwashing I could ever have imagined. Google changed.,L
I'm on mobile but paymoneywubby just did a video about this too. His take is definitely aimed at being funny but is still rightfully critical of how fucking creepy this stuff it. His ones about kids doing asmr and music.ly are pretty enlightening and hilarious.,C
"Yep, my daughter started watching toy opening videos. It was like they hypnotized her. Absolutely no value in them in any way. I nixed youtube altogether at that point unless I'm watching with them. That was before I even knew about Elsagate,  I had another friend who let his daughter continue unsupervised with the toy unwrapping stuff and she found her way into all the weirdness for a long time before her dad found out.",C
PBSKids.org my dude.,C
"That was a few years ago, my daughter is now past that stage and into terrible Nickelodeon kid comedies. They aren't exactly educational but they aren't just something designed to activate her dopamine receptors.  Also I make her read books a good bit too so her brain doesn't atrophy from just watching ""The Thundermans"".",C
🎵 doink doink doink doink ... P B S kids! 🎵,L
🎶 Every day when you're walking down the street 🎵,C
"Here's a TedTalk on the subject. The only time my kids see Youtube is when I'm in the room, watching it with them. Can go from ""Oh this is cute"" to ""Holy shit wtf"" in a few videos...",L
https://www.ted.com/talks/james_bridle_the_nightmare_videos_of_childrens_youtube_and_what_s_wrong_with_the_internet_today?language=en,C
Folding Ideas on YouTube also did a 15min video about the subject. He goes into how they are gaming the algorithm. https://youtu.be/LKp2gikIkD8,L
"I don't get it. Why can't they just take advtanage of the algorithm, make bank, and just make something that isn't fucked up. So parents will see it and just think, wow this is stupid... Not wow this is awful I don't want my children watching this. Then noone really complains and there's even less pressure for youtube to fix it",L
The shocking content itself likely help drive the algorithm up the charts.,C
"It gets paused and rewatched by kids. Adults read about it on social media and rewatch it, a subreddit gets created due to its shocking content.",C
Man this is nuts! The greed of a handful of people may stunt an entire generation if they grow up on this shit.,L
Elsagate is real,C
Use something like Internet Download Manager and just download the videos you want them to see.  Make that their viewing selection.,L
Pbskids.org maybe?,C
Youtube is a cesspool,C
Damn I can't access this in Canada!,L
"“...This program was made possible by viewers not like you at all.  No thank you, hoser.”",L
The one instants where Disney could abuse the copyright system and the internet would give them a free pass.,C
"Honestly if they could make a ""channel lock"" feature so you can create a ""kids account"" that can only watch videos from channels you've pre-approved, the problem would go away. I don't know why they don't do this when a lot of online services already do.",L
"I was curious about this, since it made no sense to me that they wouldn't already have that option. After approximately 3 seconds of googling, it turns out that that exact thing does exist in the parental controls settings. There is a toggle for 'approved content only' that lets you whitelist channels and videos.",L
"I just don't let my kids watch YouTube anymore, at it's worst it's extremely eyebrow raising and fucked up...but even worse, at it's best it's just them sitting there lobotomized watching kids open 1000 presents or some shitty 20min long version of wheels on the bus animated in India that could legitimately pass for something out of a dystopian film where they rot our kids brains out.",C
"This is why if my kid has a device to watch videos on, he only gets official TV channel apps or Netflix kids. We used to watch Sesame Street on YouTube, but I noticed the same thing—after a few episodes, it’s at best character toy videos, but it’s also Sesame Street melee videos I don’t want my 2 year old watching. We have an old phone of my husband’s we give him for long car rides and we straight up deleted the YouTube app from it. I get that YouTube wants to run their algorithms and show off their tech prowess or whatever, but if they’re going to have a kids’ platform, they need to use actual people over there. It’s way too easy to slip things through their filters.",C
That is why you don't give a child access to youtube anylonger. Two years back I noticed those videos and asked friends with kids they all experienced the same. Youtube unsupervised is a nogo now for my daughter.,L
"edit: What was weird about those videos how the children who watched them would be drawn to them and select them from the recommended lists on their own. Most parent likely selected a cartoon, bob the builder, the smurfs or something innocent but they would due to autoplay and clicking land with the weird stuff. A friend of mine hat a 3/4 year old which she occasionally gave her handy to for a quick cartoon on youtube, he would eventually land on those weird videos on his own. Like they were tailored for little kids. Really disturbing. Like I said youtube app was gone from the ipad afterwards. Surprised those videos still appear to exists, was already years ago when I first saw this...",C
"As a corollary, if a website allows user generated content, then as a rule of thumb you shouldn't let your child visit that website unsupervised.",L
"The thing is, YouTube has a ""kids mode"" that's supposed to be safe for kids, but it's not curated, it's just bots deciding what's kid safe and what isn't, so it lulls a lot of parents into a false sense of security.",C
"Those too when they can actually find them, hell its why they stopped monetizing things that weren't family friendly. YouTube faces the  problem that their business model does not function without user uploaded content yet it can't cost effectively screen all the User Uploaded content it needs to function and certainly not without unacceptable delay.",L
"Edit: Fixed grammar, am tired. plz forgive.",C
Yet lawmakers want to make it that they screen everything for copyrighted content... they can't figure out something much more important and you want to stretch their resources thin? I don't want to think about smaller video uploader sites.,L
"Playing devil's advocate, flagging copyrighted content is easier than flagging inappropriate content.",C
"Copyrighted content is a (giant, but finite) amount of specific, measurable things to detect. It's far easier to detect a song a la shazam, than it is to detect abstract concepts such as  ""disturbing"", ""violent"" or ""sexual"".",L
"YouTube said the videos removed mainly had inappropriate adult content or spam, but it did not offer much insight into how it is managing the large amount of hateful or conspiratorial videos.",L
"A spokeswoman said the company, owned by Google, is confident a new algorithm will work to stamp out inappropriate content.",C
From the article.,L
The last huge ban i remember included alot of drug safety and harm reduction videos. They are hurting people by banning all of these videos.,L
"Yet they won’t ban Pervy Mommy, r/elsagate videos, or children shaking their asses for music.ly videos.",L
YouTube is just riding the Current Event moral high-ground and doesn’t give a shit about the well-being of children; they only care about their profit.,C
What are the pervy mommy videos? I havent heard about them til this thread,L
https://youtu.be/hc4HzbD0GLI,C
This is the same dude that brought to light how creepy music.ly videos are and how YouTube lets those videos stay up even though children are uploading themselves sexually suggestively dancing... all because of ad revenue and the millions of views they get.,L
"TJ Miller is amazing, didn’t see this new upload! Hopefully he gets another copyright strike!",L
"Meanwhile they leave the pedo child videos up that I gave to block so my kid can watch her shows, while mine all get fucking demonetized or banned. Fuck YouTube. They demonitize for even mentioning drug safety or suicide awareness. Seriously, FUCK YOUTUBE.",L
My Nickleback tribute video got taken down in the wake of this sweep. So mean.,C
The ai confused hatespeech with singing that people hate.,C
"Damn, that's too bad.",L
"They flagged six of Mumkey Jones’s videos within twelve hours, completely destroying both of his channels simply because he talked about Elliot Rodger.",L
They terminated all of his channels as well. He made a video on a third channel to talk about how his two channels were terminated just to have that account expunged as well. He’s probably not gonna get them back and it’s troubling.,C
"Funny thing is, a lot of the content is BLATANT satire meant to MOCK Rodgers. Calling him ""Saint Elliot"" in the middle of a patently hilarious pro-incel diatribe. It's completely and utterly impossible to mistake for something genuine.",L
People should be freaking out about this. Google's social engineering is truly frightening,L
We’ll see what they really removed when it comes to their standards of ‘hateful or inappropriate content’. How much you want to bet that the same shit that SHOULD be taken down is still there and the rest will be for things that just don’t make any sense.,L
Guess they weren’t too happy about their own video being the most hated in the world?,C
"They got rid of Pastor David Manning, so the full version of the flaming butthole video is gone, unless someone saved it.",L
"Comedy gold, gone.",L
"https://youtu.be/lF19XWWyREE Here’s someone else’s clip, for anyone interested. The original video is like 15 minutes.",L
Edit: I found a more complete version. It has the part about asbestos diapers and “chairs where people can stand up”. https://youtu.be/f61zsLFQWRc,L
"Man, I guess that's one way to become the Human Torch.",C
Flame On!,C
"""Johnny, where are you going with that giant butt plug?""",C
"""No time to talk. Mister Fantastic needs me!""",L
"""Wait. What?""",L
"Mother of god, this is amazing. If I didn't grow up in the South, I would've thought this was an Onion video.",L
They removed both of Mumkey Jones' channels because apparently making fun of Elliot Rodger/incel culture is promoting school shootings. As per usual they cast way too wide of a net and a bunch of innocent YouTubers lost their main source of income.,L
Edit: spelled mumkey wrong,C
"Really? Damn, I just watched all his Elliot Rodger stuff a month or two ago.",L
And you already know they didn't touch any of Logan Pauls videos because he is making then to much money,L
They deleted a video of my dog that died last year. I don't have a backup of it and It's all we had left of her!,L
"What the actual fuck, man.",L
Edit: Getting a lot of messages about this. I HAD a backup of the video and many others of my dog but my basement flooded and killed the server and the backup drives last year when she was still with us and in the moment you don't realise how important that stuff is until they are gone. After rebuilding I never actually thought of re-downloading it because we just watch it online when we miss her the most.,L
"Message youtube, there's a chance they have a copy since it would be wise to assume there'd be mistakes in the banning spree",L
And then make a copy of shit that's important to you. Don't trust off-site hosting for your important data!,C
Sounds like YouTube wanted to reduce their monthly storage costs a bit.,C
Was YouTube Rewind 2018 included?,C
"It should be, it was awful",C
Aw that's hot.That's hot.,L
"Wii CunTOll WeWindE tHiZ yEaR""",L
did they have people comb through videos or is this another algos mass deletion?,L
"Algorithms, it’s not feasible to use manual review.",L
But did they remove those creepy mom videos? Wait nvm. Theyre all 'educational' videos about 'parenting',L
Been hearing the term creepy mom videos for a few days. What did I miss?,L
"A youtuber did a video where he uncovers weird sexual videos where mom's play with their kids. The mom does upskirt shots, rubbing, breast feeding,  and even purposefully places the baby's hand on her boobs.",C
So it is an obvious sex related channel for pedophiles (or someone with a fetish for mom playing with their kids). The videos have millions of views within hours.,C
Edit: here's the video,L
Edit 2: original thread,L
Holy shit. The videos even have a warning for disturbing content at the front which is a real red flag if it's a video including parent and child.,C
Yeahhhh that link is staying blue.  I feel nauseated at even the thought of that being a real thing.,C
"From what I've seen and heard there seems to be a lot of people getting really tired of Youtube, buy they also got a sort of monopoly on video-sites. Do you guys think there will ever be an alternative to Youtube that people will migrate to if stuff gets super shitty? Or do we just gotta roll with it?",L
"I think the internet is getting too closed now. Corporations and advertising are getting so close to having 100% control, like with all other forms of media. I think this will get MUCH worse before it gets better.",C
"it’s ridiculous that youtube has shifted to this view. Some of my favorite videos growing up were raunchy as hell, but that’s what made the platform great - you cant find that stuff on TV. Now creators can’t cuss without getting ads removed from their videos. Looks like they are getting straight up removed at this point.",C
Yet soft core porn with women flashing panties masquerading as 'cleaning tips' is monetized out the wazoo. Its insane.,C
Thank god we have a big corporation like Google to teach us morality! 🙄,C
"A lot of these big websites are succumbing to ""moral outrage"" purge sprees now, it seems.",L
"That's a very broad definition. Lost a lot of documentaries on sensitive and not so sensitive subjects. Probably automated, but there seems to also be some channels getting banned",L
They deleted my 'flat earth' troll channel. Fuck YouTube.,C
They deleted a video of me showing an erratic driver. The fuck is this. That video had been on since 2012.,L
"Must have thought you misspelled ""erotic driver.""",L
Damn sexy drivers distracting me while I drink and drive.,L
erratic driver must have worked for Youtube.,L
"The worst part, is if any flat earthers get removed from this, it will fuel the fire.",C
"""SEE. YOUTUBE IS IN IT WOTH NASA!""",L
Is that real? Why would they? Being flat earther is dumb but not inappropriate wtf.,C
"Last time they did this they nuked all the videos I made about the process of dealing with suicidal depression. I walked people through how to find low cost therapists, what to expect when taking medication, suggestions on how to deal with the stigma behind the whole thing...it was doing really well and people loved it. Then one day, with no warnings or emails or anything, they were all gone. There was no copy written music, I didn't use foul language, I damn sure didn't glorify suicide like every edgy teenager on YouTube these days.  Just ""fuck you"".",L
"YouTube can suck my ass, they have no idea what that are doing. That aren't the arbiters of good taste.",L
Have they removed the 2018 Rewind?,L
This would be a good time for a new competing platform to emerge,C
"I guess, it will be a long time, until any AI comes anywhere near to being able to distinguish between hate speech and, say, satire without the help of absolutely unbiased, neutral humans of great wisdom :)",C
"And what is a joke in one culture, could be an insult in another and vice versa. I wouldn't want the task to fix that, nope.",C
I see that they wanted to steal tumblr's thunder.,L
are they finally taking the isis recruitment videos down? or just infowars type stuff?,L
"They hit anyone who had anything even remotely related to ""non ad friendly content"". People who had documentaries on serial killers for example had their channels wiped off the platform for hate speech.",C
They wiped true crime stuff for hate speech? Nonsensical and really unfortunate.,L

Police beat a non violent veteran protesters during occupy wall street so badly that they lacerated his spleen. They did so on video. They left him in jail overnight with no medical attention and he nearly died.,L
"My dad beat me when I was a kid and I turned out okay. He even took my door away for most of my teenage years. Sure I've got severe anxiety and depression issues. Yea, I live in a bus so I can keep my bedroom in the parking lot nearby to tone down my anxiety down. Sure I can't really have a relationship, or even touch another person sober.

Yeah its one thing to discipline its another thung when you almost beat a kids organ till bursting...thats straight abuse,L
One is abuse and other is extreme abuse.,C
"If a parent is responsible enough to give out a well executed educationally punishing spanking, don't you think that same parent would be able to come up with a better punishment that doesn't include physical assault?  Most parents who spank aren't doing it the way you seem to be envisioning.",L
I'm not envisioning it as though it's some hypothetical. It was done to me by very warm and loving parents. It's the way I see my sister raise her four very well adjusted girls.  I've been around well restrained corporal punishment my whole life and have seen it used effectively by very loving parents in perfectly appropriate contexts. Nobody was being abused.,C

"a calm, well articulated spanking, doesn't hurt your physically but it takes an emotional toll and leads to all kind of mental health issues down the road. Since it is not physically visible, abuse victims find it hard to accept that spanking and other forms of ""love assaults"" are actually terrible for children. ""Spanking"" is emotional torture and people defend spanking as nothing more than parenting are psychopaths.",C
"Agreed. I was spanked relentlessly as a child and while I’m “fine,” I wonder what deep rooted traits about my personality and demeanor would be different if I wasn’t.",C
"I have a 1.5 year old son and a 3.5 year old daughter and the only time I’ve even raised my voice at them was because of a safety concern. My daughter is well behaved and respectful to others, but it takes a lot of work. Spanking and instilling fear is the easy way out.",C
Agree. Parenting is hard. Kudos to you for treating your kids with respect and taking the hard way to raise your kids.,C
Yeah the only reason to be physical with your kids is when they're too young to understand an explanation as to why playing in the road will kill them.,C
(And even then they shouldn't be in the road anyway).,L

"There are myriad examples of children thriving and succeeding without being spanked, which (along with the various studies on the subject) would tend to suggest that it's not ""necessary"" to carry out spankings.",C
It suggests that there are different ways of going about things depending on the personality from kid to kid.,L
"So if you can make your child successful without spanking and you think spanking is necessary to make them successful, then aren't you a psychopath?",L
How the fuck do you think countries that ban spanking manage then?,L
Or do you think some countries don't have certain personality types?,L
"Realistically, most of the Reddit audience right now is closer to the getting-spanked age than the giving-spankings age. The replies in this thread are ridiculous, but not entirely unexpected.",L
"ridiculous, but not entirely unexpected",L
Could be a Reddit tag line.,L
You can be a successful psychopath,L
Your kids can be successful and still suffering from lifelong depression due to childhood abuse.,C

A rebirth of the American textile industry would be amazing.,L
YES please,C
They could remake the office but on weed.,L
So just the office?,L
Hey man you ever try selling paper...on weeeeeed?,C
why would it? Either machines would do all the work or the job gets outsourced to third world like every other menial labor factory industry.,C
"It would allow more Domestic manufacturers to complete. There are only a handful of Domestic companies left, would be nice to buy clothes that are designed to last instead of replacing every year or so.",L
"Producing the raw materials doesn't mean you're going to manufacture the final product.  The US is still the third largest producer of cotton, we just export most of it now instead of using it to create products here.",C
I assume much the same thing would happen with domestic hemp production.,L
Its better for paper than trees. Better for plastic than oil.,L
Both from an economic and environmental standpoint.,L
If you are against global warming you are for industrial Hemp. Plain and simple,L
They will just ship it to China.,C
Hemp was never a popular or good choice for clothing.,C
"Cotton and flax were top choices for hundreds of years, for good reason.",L
"Hemp was a top choice for cordage in some parts of the world, but later lost favor to cheaper or better plant fibers.",L
"Today you wouldn't choose hemp to tie down a load, go rock climbing, or use on a sailboat.",L
"Yeah, but it’s like, related to pot, maaaan!",C
"Tremendous potential here. This bill is a start but full-scale legalization would provide the US a huge advantage to globally export hemp, marijuana, and other derived products.",L
Hemp is already widely availible on the international market. How would this provide the US with an advantage?,C
"Yeah, I was under the impression that hemp is so cheap that it isn't worth growing over food or whatever for your average farmer",C
This is probably true right now but if we utilize hemp and create industries to replace things like plastic or pulp from trees it will gain value. Hemp is one of the most versatile plants in existence.,C
Figure out how to turn it into fuel and you'll be rich.,C
A widely used fuel source that is.,L
When it's dry it burns real good. Seen many a ditch weed ditch on fire for control burns.,L
Don't believe the hype.,L
Why? Do you have evidence of the contrary?,C
It's relatively energy intensive to process hemp into all these products that people prop up as why hemp is like gods plant. Yes it's super versatile if you have the resources and energy to process it properly.,C
"Is it better than using petroleum or pulp trees? Yeah, but it's not the silver bullet that's going to save all of our problems like it's sometimes advertised.",C
"We should still totally move towards using hemp more, but I would just say tread carefully about grandiose statements.",L
"You can also eat hemp seeds (delicious substitute for sesame seeds and even things like pine nuts in salad) and at the moment at least, they’re a nice high value crop. It l seems to come out of Canada at the moment.",C
Not that high value. Generally returns on hemp farms are between 200 to 750 per acre. Even if you have a 10 acre hemp farm that's 7500 a year...,L
This part sucks,L
"The Drug Policy Alliance, one of the nation's most potent champions for cannabis legalization, didn't take a position on the farm bill. The group tried to strike language that prohibits folks with drug convictions from working in the industry for 10 years.",L
"""We’re not celebrating,"" said Grant Smith, the alliance's deputy director of national affairs. ""For people who have a recent conviction it's essentially a de facto ban.""",C
"""There’s all this talk of criminal justice reform and here we have this brand new legalized industry that could create a lot of new jobs in areas where they're badly needed,"" he said. ""They're going to be deterred from contributing to our economy. It doesn't make any sense.",C
"Otherwise, this is great!",C
"This is excellent news. And we’re only, what, about 100 years late ? 🤪",L
"85 I'd say. Weed used to be legal in many areas, but it was mostly outlawed along with prohibition. When we ended prohibition on alcohol, we kept the prohibition of marijuana in tact partially because that's what black people liked to do.",C
How much money per acre?,L
About a century late! But fuck yeah!,L
"I'm interested to see how CBD and THC end up handling actual scientific testing. I know the effects are exaggerated, but by how much? See how they compare to placebo and actual effectiveness across subjects and conditions.",C
"For THC to get meaningful clinical study, cannabis has to first be removed from the Federal “schedule 1” designation. Until that happens it will remain (as it has for decades) too expensive or in some cases literally impossible to get through all the red tape necessary to do large scale, scientifically meaningful clinical trials with the substance.",C
"You can get all the OxyContin and Fentanyl you want for clinical trials though... cause you know, that stuff isn’t dangerous at all.",L
That isn't necessarily true outside of the US.,L
About the THC or opioids?,L
Cannabis in general. https://www.leafly.com/news/health/the-top-medical-cannabis-studies-of-2017,C
Working with someone trying to cut down on pain meds and disappointed in the usefulness of CBD and THC in replacing opioid pain relief.,C
"It's not magic, nor does it work for all kinds of pain.",L
"I am a pharmacist and was extremely skeptical for years... But crohns disease put me into a flare where I was unable to eat for several days, and I finally decided to give CBD a try. I am shocked at how well it has worked for pain and nausea.",C
That is great. Do you notice a difference between the strains or brands? It still seems to be pretty wild west with CBD. It's hard to trust all of the random brands to keep popping up.,C
"I've only tried a few so far. I'd say the joints have definitely worked better than edibles, and I'm not sure if it's a route or dosing thing, or the fact that the plant material has some THC while edibles are probably pure CBD.",L
Just possession of the oil is a felony in my state.,C
"Without the proper authorizations and prescriptions, I could get put away for a long time. Traveling is going to be tough until some more laws get changed.",C
It's a catch 22. Schedule 1 means it has no medical value (it's part of the definition) but you're not allowed to prove that it has since it's schedule 1.,C
"cause you know, that stuff isn’t dangerous at all.",C
"That's not how scheduling works and you know it. Should pot be rescheduled? You bet! Should we continue spreading false information? Hey, whatever gets you the most upvotes.",L
This is part of the reason why Canada legalizing was so huge. We can get real scientific studies to find out all of the medical uses for THC and CBD.,C
We could also benefit from knowing all of the socioeconomic and medical consequences of THC and CBD. It would be cool knowing what dosage of marijuana is safe to consume before damaging your body.,L
Every dose is safe. THC does not damage your body.,L
"False. It is already known that smoking marijuana has negative effects on brains that are not fully developed. Pharmacology & Therapeutics,Volume 148, April 2015, Pages 1-16",L
I am all for legalization for a variety of reasons but please don't pretend taking THC has zero consequences.,L
I know the effects are exaggerated,L
You know this how?,L
The claims reach snake oil levels. I also help with several people who are under medical marijuana treatment. If all you want to do is get high then that's good.,L
Just because someone with a youtube channel makes claims doesn't mean that the majority of cannabis users support that claim.,C
"If some moron claims that alcohol cures his cancer, that doesn't mean that most people who drink or produce alcohol think that is true.",L
I find its the government that overstates the dangers of cannabis by an extreme amount.,L
"I agree. We need to separate truth from all the crap made up by hucksters. Same as we have to do for big pharma creations. That's why I am looking for actual studies. The plural of anecdote is anecdotes, not scientific data.",L
The fact that he was immediately downvoted seems to lend credence to his argument.,L
"Anecdotal at most. A lot of people are taking cannabis ""to relieve pain"", like really, you have pain and you think cannabis will help on it's own? Only a crazy person will expect a ganja pill to work in the same way as opioids, cannabis is not a pain killer. It allows for relaxation and comfort. Where most pain derives from tension, inflammation and stress, cannabis relieves these and in turn reduces pain.",C
"I don't have studies at my fingertips to back up my assertion, but I use medical cannabis for shingles (postherpetic neuralgia, to be exact), and I can attest that marijuana relieves nerve pain that opioids don't even begin to touch.",L
"Possibly nerve damage issues involve different pathways from other types of inflammation? I really don't know, but I do know for me it's in no way a placebo effect.",L
In California and Colorado many labs are posting false lab results.,L
https://mjbizdaily.com/falsified-california-testing-lab-data-may-result-in-major-marijuana-product-recall/,C
They aren’t exaggerated,C
"First off, my name isn't Jesus. The claims have it being a miracle for everything that ails you. There's no way it does everything everybody claims it does. I spend a lot of time at dispensaries, and I still doubt its effectiveness around the general population. I can't legally take THC, but I assist with several people who do, and it's disappointing watching them feel let down.",C
"Yea youre totally full of shit my man. Theres literally tens of thousands of people saying the opposite, what are they all liars because you, someone who cant even legally use the stuff, makes some shitty observation of others? Marijuana doesnt take away pain, no medicine does. It’s there to help dull the effects of the pain. Maybe thats why you see someone react that way, because they still have the pain. Either way, you definitely have no idea what youre on about.",L
Anecdotal evidence does not help your claim but okie dokie.,L
Is it possible to discuss actual issues without attacking? I state that there are exaggerations and the rebuttal is typically the equivalent of calling someone a poopy head,C
You're essentially using prohibitionist talking points by focusing only on the most extreme claims made by a minority of people.,C
"Lots of prohibitionists start their arguments by knocking down the strawman of cannabis being a miracle cure, something that close to nobody is seriously claiming.",C
Tell that to my cramps that my THC tampon is obliterating right now.,C
Ok folks which stocks,C
I don't get it.  Hemp is grown in other countries already.  It's not like the stuff doesn't exist and it's just been discovered.  So where is this huge market?  Are we all going to start buying more rope?,L
"The University of Washington made a 1/2"" piece of plywood out of hemp, that was stronger than steel and I think fireproof?",L
Just in time for adults to return to politics and make hemp a substitute for damning industries that won’t seem to die.,C
"I hope so, I just want access to cheap rope that doesn't lacerated your hands.",L
I'm pretty sure hemp is impractical for things like fabric and rope unless you're selling to people that specifically want hemp and will pay a higher price for it.,C
Anyone with a brain know Hemp will replace tobacco and soy farms easily. Hopefully Bayer/Monsanto keep their greasy paws out.,C
e: I stand corrected. It must not be obvious to people.,L
How will hemp replace tobacco?,C
"Tobacco is expensive to grow, requires more pesticides and soil amendments than most other crops, requires extra infrastructure to process, has only one end-use/industry, and has dwindling domestic demand.",C
"Hemp is cheap to grow, has very high demand domestically and abroad, has many potential end-uses and industries, and is less destructive to top-soil. The problem with hemp is that there isn't a lot of machinery/infrastructure to process it, as most of that was abandoned when it was made illegal decades ago.",C
"Super easy to grow and extremely profitable for industrial use. Specifically Kentucky, which have some of the largest tobacco farms in the country, was at one point the largest hemp industry, producing 75% of all hemp in the US.",C
"So if hemp brings better returns, is easier to grow, and will only have more industrial uses, there is little reason for a farmer to put their stock in tobacco which is already a declining industry.",C
Potential earnings. We are talking about what they grow not products available.  Farmers can stop living off subsidies and grow actual for profit crops. Tobacco is a dying industry.,L
"Super easy to grow and extremely profitable for industrial use. Specifically Kentucky, which have some of the largest tobacco farms in the country, was at one point the largest hemp industry, producing 75% of all hemp in the US.",C
"So if hemp brings better returns, is easier to grow, and will only have more industrial uses, there is little reason for a farmer to put their stock in tobacco which is already a declining industry.",C
TLDR; Hemp makes more money.,L
Same for Virginia and North Carolina.,L
"""Big Tobacco"" is already investing into Marijuana.",L
"The Drug Policy Alliance, one of the nation's most potent champions for cannabis legalization, didn't take a position on the farm bill. The group tried to strike language that prohibits folks with drug convictions from working in the industry for 10 years.",L
Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.,L
Its better for paper than trees. Better for plastic than oil.,L
Both from an economic and environmental standpoint.,L
If you are against global warming you are for industrial Hemp. Plain and simple.,L
Edit. Also Hemp seeds are a great source of omega 3 fatty acids.,L
I've been researching the viability of converting the family pulp tree farm to hemp in the coming years.,L
Turns out you don't make that much money off of hemp. Like maxing out at 750 per acre per crop.,L
"So while it's a beautiful thing to have an annual income with hemp rather than the years it takes to grow trees, the overall profitability isn't really there to convert to hemp considering how low effort it is to grow trees.",L
"I'm sure it is going to make sense for some people, but the market kinda dictates right now that we won't see a super fast explosion of hemp farms even after the bill is passed.",C
"Is the measure denying Congress to stop US involvement in Yemen taken out yet? If not, sorry, but legalizing industrial hemp isnt worth continuing to support genocide through starvation.",C
"Hemp is super great, and it being legalized will make the rural areas, which have been devastated for years, to recover.",C
"The only problem is that this happened under the Trump administration, so I’m a little worried whether this will help them win again in 2020 as a result of the rural voters.",L
I know... right?,C
Wouldn't want someone who managed to help people get re-elected.,L
"This is hardly his doing. It was a bipartisan bill that was introduced under republican leadership. He had nothing to do with it besides signing it, which any dem would have done.",L
which any dem would have done,L
You mean which any dem should have done with the last farm bill passage 4 years ago and didn't.,C
I know it pains you to give credit where credit is due but this bill would have never come into consideration had it not been for the trade war.,C
"Yeah, when congress was proclaiming as loud as they could that they would block everything Obama put forward?",C
Glad Trump is doing this.,C
"Before people get too excited for the wrong reasons, better look at the family tree, C. sativa sativa is for industrial use, C. sativa indica has recreational/medical uses.",L

This is starting to follow a pattern we've seen before.,C
History repeats itself,C
Only this time they made sure to have every other country in their pocket so no one can stop them.,L
damn this is sad :(,L
"I actually believe having every country in your pocket would be counter intuitive at some point. That point would be right around the tipping point of “oh crap, China is demanding we pay them back but we don’t have the money,” and that’s when mini skirmishes will break out, with their military spreading thin and other countries simply weaseling out of deals. Then the revolution!",C
Unfortunately it's less about oweing money and more about China being deeply integrated in a world economy that is more globalised than ever before. There will be now war between the economically important nations bc it's just not worth risking the highly profitable status quo.,C
But nobody cares it seems,L

"I feel that the people who quote that line only watched the movie. Paul Verhoeven was making a completely unrelated movie before someone at the studio read the screenplay and decided to shift things over to Starship Troopers.

"It's satire, actually!",L
"Call me a pedant, but this is a perfect example of the difference between satire and parody.  Satire is when something is ridiculed with the specific goal of portraying something in a shameful or negative way.  Parody is the more lighthearted cousin of satire that doesn't necessarily try to pass judgement.",C
"tl;dr: If you are being parodied, we're laughing with you.  If you're satirized, we're laughing at you.",C
"“Parody” is the wrong word. What Verhoevan made was a brutal deconstruction of the themes  of the book - it’s never a comedy or parodic in nature. If you get to the end of the film and still haven’t noticed you’ve been following the bad guys the whole time, Neil Patrick Harris pops up in a Nazi uniform to beat you over the head with the point. Subtle? Not at the end, but the rest of the movie plays out like such a generic war story that a lot of people did miss it. It’s actually a surprisingly mean-spirited thing for one artist to do to another.",L
I thought the movie was fantastic despite the best intentions of the Director.  It doesn’t mince words and offers a truly chilling insight into how easily and enthusiastically we could adapt to merciless military authoritarianism.,L

"Deliberately casting good-looking but average-to-terrible actors? Sounds like something a government propaganda film would do. Tell a basic, we-save-the-world story that’s almost completely by the numbers? Definitely propaganda. In fact the only two scenes that undercut this are the slaughter of the soldiers by bugs, which is filmed in dim colours and horrendously graphic in comparison to the sanitised version shown earlier, and the aforementioned bit where NPH is a Nazi. Truly spectacular film making but also makes it really easy to dismiss as a poorly-acted generic story, because it’s doing its job really well.",C

This is kind of off topic. But you know a country’s population is massive when a minority population is 12 million people.,L
Many leaders do unfortunately.,C
"Its simply part of the process of sowing the seeds for their own ruin.  1984 was so scary because it presented a stable system.  This isn't stable.  You don't get to hold a million innocent people in forced labour camps and come out of it with a functioning society.  What you are doing right now is taking a million people (perhaps 1:10,000 of whom wished you harm) and making each and every one of them go to sleep at night smiling at the image of your cities in flames, your people desperate refugees.  Look at what the US is dealing with for literally hundreds of years post slavery.  What sane person would invite that kind of trouble?",L
The system is very sophisticated and they have accounted for some weaknesses of the average totalitarian regime. The culture is tailor made for state above individual. And the integrated use of technology is unprecedented for the means of suppression.,L

"We are getting to a point where the atrocities committed by the Chinese government are becoming hard to ignore, while at the same time their power is growing to immense proportions.

We're well past that point--our people are merely skilled in ignoring inconvenient truths that require action and sacrifice to address,C

"China is what it is today because it was the first place the developed world really mass exported labour to. Without that helping hand, China would never have grown anywhere near as quickly as they have since the mid 90s. The current problem in the US with growing Chinese dominance is largely self inflicted.",C
"Never, EVER, forget that our economic ruling class sold out everyone else in this country for cheap overseas labor. Look around at our broken, suicidal working-class that turns to opioids and remember why our country is this way. Drive through Detroit and look at row after row of empty factories and remember that we all let this happen so the rich could get richer.",C
Our elites shook hands with the Chinese elites and then pissed on their own countrymen.,C
The general population is definitely complicit. A majority of us simply want cheaper things.,L
We want cheaper things because wages are kept so low. Wealth is disproportionately distributed to the upper class that outsourced to overseas cheap labor in the first place,C
"The whole transition to overseas manufacturing happened in such a sly, steady way that people didn't realize what was happening until it already happened. Of course plenty did, but mostly these enormous changes to our society happened in a completely un-democratic way fostered directly by the richest people in this country.",C
"Well said.  I started with something that directly impacts me and my health: food.  Some of the nastiest stuff is done to Chinese mass produced stuff and there have been many scandals and undoubtedly many left hidden away.  Most Chinese, for example, will not trust their own local milk powder products due to melamine being mixed in.  While that may have been exposed (due to deaths), there are many other practices such as garlic bleaching and injecting seafood with ""plumping"" agents.  All enough to make you realize that if it's cheap, there's a cost cut somewhere at your expense.",C

"The capitalists who spearheaded moving our industry to China weren't shortsighted idiots. They were just evil, greedy, bastards.",L
"They were just evil, greedy, bastards.",L
Actually it's our system which is flawed. CEOs are legally required to maximize shareholder value. We've setup a system where NOT moving the jobs to China could get executives fired.,C
"If your system requires businesses to be greedy, they're going to be greedy.",L
"Chinese on the other hand, have government and business working together closely to produce wealth for their society.  Much like the South Koreans and the Japanese before them. It's like America is playing checkers and they are playing chess.",C

One can very easily act ethically and match shareholder interests. The excuse you this guy of is bullshit created by unethical directors attempting to move blame away.,C

This is fucking evil,L

"What I found most surprising is that other countries know about this and still don't make it illegal to get organ donations from China, still don't intervene in helping these people, countries continue to empower China by buying everything from them, its disgusting.",L
Ya it’s their chief strategy obviously,C
"Doesn't matter if they're a fringe cult or minor religion, you can't just cage them like livestock and kill them for their organs...",C

The only peaceful way to end this is if Xi and the entire communist party were taken care of, which is a pretty tall order. They wanna go full socialist (with Chinese characterics).

Not an increase to bring back jobs, but one to pressure China into adhering to international laws of trade, stop their genocides, stop their territorial expansion in the South China Sea, and stop their industrial espionage of thousands of companies.",C
"At one point action must be taken. Just like the sanctions on Russia, China must be punished by the West for actions inexcusable by rationality and international law.",L
"Good luck with that, considering it would lead to a noticeable quality of life drop for the population of every embargoing country. Genocide won't have people up in arms but a lack of consumer electronics and cheap shit they don't need certainly will.",L
There will never be action because... well...,C
It's not profitable.,L
"I know it's horrible to say that, but that's basically the brutal truth. Those people aren't worth anything to the powers that be, so they will die. And the central authority in China has decided to make their deaths more useful.",L

Are there any Muslim majority countries actively trying to do anything about this? I just keep hearing about it in western media.,C
"There's plenty of exposure in Middle Eastern and North African news broadcast, but I don't know if theres any concerted effort to do anything about it. China has a long history of abusing their religious and political minority and the world seems pretty helpless to stop it.",C
I find it funny that anyone would expect Muslim countries to even want to do something about it.,C
"They've already abandoned Palestinians, and those are ethnic Levantines.  They're not going to care about some half-european converts in the middle of Central Asia.  Also China's a teensy bit scarier than Israel.",L
Not to mention that China still hasn't come anywhere near the the level of the west vis-a-vis the ethnic Arab world; when China starts 7 different wars in the Mideast I think we can really expect some fireworks.  Until then they're still small fry from a Muslim POV.,C
"As a Muslim, I’m disgusted by the lack of backbone exhibited by these ‘Islamic’ countries. Whenever any atrocity or tragedy befalls a Muslim peoples, they sit on their piles of gold in silence. Forget any issue the Muslim community has against ‘the West,’ the Muslim ‘leaders’ in this world are our biggest obstacle.",C
Money (and power derived from money) is always and forever the strongest clan. For fucking ever.,C
"Most of those countries are Muslim in name only. If you check what they do, you'll instantly see that their own religion brands them as infidels.",C
"Saudia Arabia is invading a neighbouring Islamic country, killing innocent people left and right. IIRC there's a verse in the Quran stating that ""one day people will die not knowing why they died and people will be killing not knowing why they killed"" which is exactly what's going on now a days in Yemen.",L
"UAE and Kuwait are funding them kill those people, and Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, and Libya are too broken to be of any use. That leaves countries like Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan and such. But those countries have no military power what so ever.. Which leaves Qatar and Bahrain, and those two countries are in an embarrassing situation themselves, any attempt by them will give opennings to Iran to harass them.",C

"Saudi Arabia could use its oil exports as a powerful bargaining chip, but not really enough to deal with this issue. China does not have sufficient domestic oil to meet their needs. They do, however, have many other countries to import from.",L

China would be happy to import from Iran instead of Saudi Arabia.,L
"Pakistan is arguably.Chinas closest ally, but they don't have the power to tell China off.",L
"Pakistan isn't going to do shit against China, aside from some half hearted protests. They are far too dependant on China at this point.",L
"”Ally” might be putting it strongly. They are close to turning into a client state, if they aren't already.",L
'Ally' would be putting it lightly not strongly. Pakistan is becoming increasingly reliant on China as a counter to India. Major Muslim countries won't be doing or saying anything anytime soon.,L
They owe China far too much money to say anything.,L
As a Muslim:,C

No real noise in Malaysia about this. My bet is that the government does not want to get on China’s shit list.,C

That's valuable organs they need to keep fresh for sale.,L
"Keep them fed, keep them healthy and fit... for better product quality.",L
Look up much many surgeries they do for organ transplant. It far outstrips their stated supply source by multiple times.,L
"So where are they getting them from? The Falungong practitioners are some, but they aren't exactly a renewable source of organs...",L
"They've simply opened a new mine, is all. Purge the ""undesirables"" and open the way for mass settlement programs, after you ghettoize and depopulate. Use the removed people for profit.",L
It's like they've maximized the efficiency of how to solve one problem with another problem.,L
I'm horrified and impressed.,L
"Once they run out of Falun Gong organs, Muslims will follow. Then it'll be Christians, and lastly people with low social credit scores.",C
"As a Jew, I find these Chinese death camps/organ donation lobby to be no different from the Holocaust. The numbers seem to add up to 100k+ murdered for their organs per year. It might not be as quick as the Holocaust, but it's a same damned concept- dehumanizing and killing people for believing the wrong religion. Personally, I have not bought a single thing made in China since I found out about it. Completely disgusting.",L
"It might as well be since most self-described Nazis believe that the SS camps were merely ""work"" camps and not execution camps.",C
"You know, the Nazis didn't start gassing Jews at the beginning. First it was systemic discrimination, ghettoisation and then camps.",C
"For people who don't find this disturbing, how do you justify it?",L
No one finds this not disturbing. Trying to do anything about it though? That's the hard part. No country on Earth wants another large war with a big country. None. Especially when said country has nukes.,L
"That’s the big problem. Last thing anyone wants is nuclear war with China, even stopping trade with them is a deal breaker.",C
"Its like China is evolving through the West's mistakes at a rate commensurate with their growth. Unification, central government, devouring fossil fuels, slavery, lebensraum and now camps.",C

Well for starters the Chinese government will need a scapegoat for economic troubles... this is starting to sound awfully familiar.,C
"Exactly, but this time it's a 1,4 billion country with the camps, censorship, propaganda and technology already in place to do things we can't even imagine right now.",L
Didn't we do this already with the Jews...?,L
"So my question is what can we do about it? It seems nobody wants a trade war with china to hurt them financially. Anything the US does that's even slightly seen as bad for china, the rest if the world throws a fit and half the US cries that it will hurt the price of their precious iPhones.",C
"Can these headlines stop saying ""Muslims""? The Hui are doing fine. This is ethnic targeting against Uiygurs. The same thing is happening in Tibet to Buhhudist Tibetans, but the media seems to have stopped caring about that.",C
"The Hui are loyal to the government and are allowed to practice Islam unmolested. The Uiygurs do not, and are thus being genocided. Both are Muslim.",L
Some muslim minorities such as the Kazakhs and the Kyrgyz are also being detained. Some Christians as well so yeah im pretty sure this has to do with religion in general.,C
Those other two groups are closely related to Uiygurs. All of them are Turks. They are not ethnically Chinese.,L

If you were in China your social credit would decrease with that comment (if they even allowed you to say the words ""dictatorship"", ""police state"", or ""revolution"" without censorship) and you would no longer be allowed out of the country, you will be barred from many jobs and opportunities, and possibly be ""disappeared"" to be put through ""reeducation"" in internment camps if you weren't just outright killed.",C

"But the last time they tried... well, everybody knows about June Fourth Incident. They won't talk about it, but they know what happens to people who step out of line.",C
There isn’t enough Chinese youths for it to matter unless really all of them will join some revolution which isn’t going to happen. It’s the same thing as with Russia but the demographics change. Countries where youth can push big changes are ones that are ones which have big youth groups of the population pyramid.,C

Finally Justice for Harry Potter,L
"Yep, the poor boy's siblings called it the Harry Potter cupboard.",C
That's awful. Good on that older brother getting him help.,L
that shit was so fucked up. And every adult just let him go back there to be further abused.,L
Dumbledore needed Harry compliant and self-sacrificing.  Isn't it strange that he wouldn't push for Sirius Black's case to be investigated when Sirius was a member of the Order of the Phoenix and close lifelong friend of the Potters?  Dumbledore needed Harry vulnerable and compliant so he would obey Dumbledore and eventually fulfill the prophecy. Mission accomplished.,C
"Like everybody else, Dumbledore was under the impression that Serious was the Potter’s Secret Keeper. And the only way Voldemort could have found them was if the Secret Keeper didn’t do their job. Pettigrew was supposedly blown up on a street full of witnesses, so any defense Serious had wasn’t really relevant.",L
Damn that got dark,C
they had to. dumbledore used the power of Lily's blood sacrifice to imbue her sister's home with powerful magical protective enchantments that kept harry safe from harm as long as he called that place home.,L
Come on mannnn,C
Safe from harm to be the ultimate sacrifice you mean.,C
"Regardless of that fact that he wasn't really ""safe"" from harm.",L
"sure he was, up until the protection expired that is.",C
The kid was 5-0 against the most powerful dark wizard in history while the protection was active. I think his mother's sacrificed played a pretty big role in that.,C
"Voldemort and his entire team of death eaters knew exactly where harry was, but the protections in place made him untouchable until he turned 17.",C
"I meant that he was being abused and neglected so not really safe from harm. But yes very safe from the death eaters. I guess bit of an impossible situation for Dumbledore. Harry's an interesting fictional hero, very tragic.",L
"I normally would never wish harm on someone, but seriously, fuck these two. Hopefully that little boy will be able to live somewhat of a normal life, and went to a home with people who will love and care for him.",C
"Have fun in prison, cunt.",C
"I seriously just don't understand the motive for something like this.  Like, what can a 5 year old possibly do to warrant this type of punishment?",L
"I get that people can ""just be crazy"", but usually they have some fucked-up version of reality where they're not the bad guy.  I just can't fathom how you could do this to a child and not feel like you were a hideous monster.",C
Probably something like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_effect,C
"It's usually along the lines of 'I could have been so much more, so much better if I didn't have to raise YOU'  It's a completely selfish thought process.  The only thought that she was thinking is 'well, killing him is murder, and I can't go to jail, but if he starves to death, well, THAT can't be helped.'",C
She needs to be beaten everyday with bamboo until shes unable to walk.  and keep going until they bury her.,L
source: my own mother did this shit.,L
Damn; sorry to hear it.,C
"I'm a parent and understand that sometimes it is frustrating and difficult to forsake your own desires and postpone your own ambitions for the sake of your offspring.  However, it's short-sighted and just plain transference to blame the child for your own actions in getting pregnant and carrying the child to term.",L
"The motivations were probably what you'd get if you make a sociopath really, really greedy. The boy was unwelcome in the home, sure, but the dad and the stepmom also likely did not want to send him back to his biological mom as they would have to pay for child support. Instead, they sought to starve him to death.",L
This is what I don't understand... I asked on /AskReddit if any professionals could explain. No real answers.,C
Harry Potter is a lot sadder when he just has failure to thrive syndrome rather than magical abilities.,C
"Joking aside, what monster could do this to a 5 year old?",C
A jealous one,C
Man love it when my city is in the news...,L
"Oh cool, an ad that plays audio that I can't turn off, and a new site to add to my blocked list.",L
"It is one of the worst sites ever, you're not wrong. It used to be the main newspaper's website. It was never exactly the pinnacle of web journalism--they'd literally run paid real estate ads in with the main headlines. The ""social""/""weekend"" bit was always full of photos of scantily clad young women. On the other hand, it had good blogs, so you just went straight to them.",L
"But it got trashier and trashier, and the paper moved to its own domain (which has paywalls). After that, people were free to do whatever they wanted to chron.com, apparently with no sense of direction or basic humanity. That page linked above barely loads for me at all--I don't know how much of it is because of the insane amount of content it's trying to load and how much is because of how much I'm blocking, which is throwing errors it can't get past.",L
Lock her in a closet and don't feed her for a while.,L
"The sentence should add some kind of "" Only being feed with serum"" or something like that... You need to be an special kimd of human dump to do that to a kid...",L
"Nothing about rape in the article. Not sure where you're getting that from. Also, prison justice is far less common than people think.",L
two of my friend's dads went to jail for meth. prison isn't as dramatic as its portrayed. they just played dominos and watched tv all day.,L
"It's a lot like being in the Marines, really. They even borrow a lot of their tactics from boot camp work.",C
Ha! Thats funny. One of the ne’er-do-well meth dads was a marine in the 80s and a fuck up by the 2000s. But he did work out a lot and got a jail six pack in this forties,L
"I think he was saying that those 2 classes of people get it worse in prison, not that both apply here.",C
That makes more sense. I'll fix my comment. Thanks.,L
My dipshit brother is currently serving his sentence along side the rest of Pennsylvania's finest. He says the same thing. Guys who harm kids get it worse in the pokey.,L
"Keyword ""guys"". This kind of extreme gross negligent abuse might go ignored in a women's prison. I'm sure the kind of guy your favorite dipshit brother (or one of them) is talking about are the guys that molest children. Were I in prison, a fun diversion would certainly be taking a potshot at a pedo or two.",L

"Eh. We're talking about his net worth which is tied up in his equity stake in FB. He still owns those shares, so he could ""gain"" $15 billion in the future just as easily. That said, I'd wager that we've already seen peak FB, so Zuckerberg won't fully recover from this decline any time soon. At any rate, he's still worth $60bn, so it's not as if he's going to have to sell his beach house and start shopping at Wal-Mart.",C
"Edit: as /u/SilverMars points out, Facebook (the company) will probably continue to dominate, given the social media market share they've snapped up via other platforms. The acquisition of Instagram sticks out in particular.",C

You're right but we saw the same headlines on the way up and everyone was outraged.,C

They have a lot of money because the companies they started are worth a ton of money.  But unlike salary it fluctuates a ton.,L
"They have a lot of net worth. Whether they have money depends on them cashing out, receiving dividends, or borrowing against their assets. Assuming your salary numbers are correct and they aren't making a ton from being directors on top of being CEOs.",L
We should give them a tax break so they can have some cash on hand.,L

"The person you're replying to is correct.  Most of their wealth comes from capital, not labor.  And of course, income from capital is taxed at far lower rates than income from labor.",L
I wish we'd just lump them together and tax them that way.  It's ridiculous that middle class workers effectively pay far higher tax rates than do people whose wealth comes from investments.,C
"And of course, income from capital is taxed at far lower rates than income from labor.",L
Only since 2001.  It was George W Bush's top priority.,L
"Isn't it hilarious to see Republican presidential candidates firing up a bunch of Rednecks about estate taxes, which starts being taxed at 5.5 million dollars.",L
"Why? Income from investment is only taxed at lower rate for long term investments, which holds more risks.",L
"When you make money from investment you owe tax on every penny of profit, but if you lose money you can only claim loss of up to $3k per year to tax deduction purposes.",L
"So there is a lot of risk involved, and lower tax is the incentive for people to take that risk and invest in the first place, it also rewards people who invest long term instead of day trading stocks (which are taxed at normal income rate).",C
"Not them, but capital gains taxes were historically much higher, until 2nd bushes presidency.  It creates loopholes for wealthy people to avoid paying into a higher income tax bracket the way it is now.",C
I mean it's not a loophole because it's designed. It's intended to function and is functioning as intended.,C
"Additionally, imo a high cap gains rate will de-incentivize the people holding that capital from liquifying it, effectively neutralizing any taxes that would have been paid.",L
Whereas a lower cap gains rate would incentivize people holding that capital to liquify it because they pay a lower proportion of its value in taxes.,L
It's like the reason one would cut taxes for the lowest income bracket; if they have more money to spend then in theory the tax revenue will come in regardless.,C
"Income from investments is taxed at lower rates to actually give people incentive to invest in the stock market. While this is a very basic answer, it essentially was the reasoning in the past.",C
"IIRC it’s also connected to the fact that investment income is tied to corporate income, which is itself taxed, essentially making capital gains taxes “double dipping” (especially when it comes to stock dividends that come directly out of post-tax corporate income). However, ideas like “make dividends not taxable but increase direct corporate taxes to compensate” are too nuanced for modern politics, so nobody talks about it except for accountants or crazy people who want to just get rid of both taxes.",L
Some of those investments are peoples 401k.,L
401ks are already taxed as labor income.,L
people whose wealth comes from investments,C
"Investing is a risk, working class is pay protected by law",L
whats another thing to think about is that most dividends are actually double taxed. its why so many people care so much about the corporate tax rate. Thats probably why dividend tax is at a different percentage.,L
Why is it ridiculous? Invested wealth is arguably doing more for the economy than taxes do.,C
"Your tax dollars are spent on infrastructure and spending programs as the government sees fit. Your invested wealth is used for supplying growth, loans, new companies, etc.",L
It would seem that your argument is based on the premise that it's unfair that people richer than the middle class seem to contribute less in percentage to the government.,L
"I believe I saw a post on here a few weeks ago about a billionaire moving from Jersey to FL and the Jersey state government missing out on some serious tax cash, affecting their budget.",L
We have a consumer based economy though.  Therefore it makes more sense to tax labor less than investment since labor has a greater impact on consumerism.,C
"The importance of investment comes from manufacturing based economies, which we no longer have.  We outsourced manufacturing a while ago.",L
Those billionaires also use and profit off the infrastructure built by the government far more than the average middle class taxpayer,C
If that wealth is just invested in stock buybacks as it seems most of last year's tax bill seems to have not sure that benefits anyone. Wonder what % of the profits are actually put into growth that creates jobs and/or innovation.,C
"Infrastructure spending is protective against recession.  It provides lots of relatively stable, high paying, low education jobs.  Usually, when you have a huge economic boom in a country, the government ramps up infrastructure spending, and increases interest rates at the fed level, so there's a cushion for the next down turn.  This puts money into the economy in the hands of people most likely to spend that money, which then generates more taxable income.",L
"Instead, we decided to give $1.5 trillion to rich people and giant corporations and not have any mechanism for how to fund it.  Oh well.",C
Neither of those companies pays a dividend.,C
"Facebook has a lot fewer avenues for growth compared to Amazon, which probably has a lot more to do with the change in valuation.",L
"Facebook has hit maximum market penetration in the developed world for some time, and growth in the developing world is slowing down as well. We are now seeing more people no longer valuing Facebook as a growth company, hence the fall in stock price.",C
"Amazon, in contrast, still has a lot of growth potential both within its main market segment and across new ones like home automation.",C
"Instagram and WhatsApp are owned by Facebook.  While Facebook doesn't reinvest into capex as much as Amazon, they're smart enough to to acquire or grow existing services to capture market growth.",L
"This is partially why Facebook doesn't care if you delete your account on the blue website.  You probably forgot to delete your Insta or Whatsapp accounts, or just won't.",L
Where is FB HQ based? How is he allowed to take a salary of $1 - does the state FB is HQ'd in not have minimum wage laws?,C
"I take the minimum allowed out of my company, but my 'salary' is significantly less than my dividends.",C
That's actually a good question I've never thought of.  I googled it and seems like it's not entirely clear but being realistic no one is going to sue Facebook because they're underpaying Mark Zuckerberg so it's a Moo Point.,L
"Taking a $1 salary, or less, has become fashionable among an elite set, which has included everyone from Oracle’s famously rich Larry Ellison to Facebook’s just as rich Mark Zuckerberg to Meg Whitman, one of the world’s richest women.",C
"The trend started in 1997 when Steve Jobs, Apple’s former CEO, returned to the company he co-founded. With his salary at $1, Jobs was able to quickly signal he was focused more on his mission to turn around the firm that today is the world’s most valuable than on himself.",C
"Last year, the $1 Club included Zuckerberg; Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, the parent company of Google; Mark Pincus, then Zynga’s chief executive; and Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp’s top chief, according to the 2015 Equilar Silicon Valley CEO Pay Study conducted for the Bay Area News Group.",L

"Doubtful. Facebook isn't just Facebook. They've really starting going HAM in recent years and buying up competing services. Facebook itself may have peaked, but their influence is far from it.",L
"Exactly, insta and whatsapp.",L
"The thing is that Facebook is really good at getting user growth on platforms. Facebook itself is obvious, but Instagram even more notably so - insta has grown so much more since Facebook bought it than they likely would have on their own. FB will continue to buy smaller social media platforms and build them to dominate like Insta. The question is just Who's Next",C
insta has grown so much more since Facebook bought it than they likely would have on their own.,L
"To be fair, when Facebook bought it they also introduced the Android version (both things happend in April 2012). I still remember shit like #iPhoneOnly, etc.",L

"Oh well, it was a fun ramble.",L
Because you dont get that much money by being complacent.,L
Right?  The kind of person who becomes a billionaire is (typically) the kind of person who wouldn't want to retire and sit around doing nothing.  The person who dreams of years and years with nothing to do but be lazy (aka me) doesn't have the drive to become wealthy in the first place.,L
"To be clear, I'm not saying that hard work = being a billionaire OR that being a billionaire always = hard word, but even like, say what you will about Trump, the guy will never sit still, I don't think. People like Zucc or Bezos or Jobs would probably be miserable sitting on a beach sipping Coronas some place.",L

"The deficit is a huge issue, but let's just show the numbers, because I think you're drawing conclusions from very insignificant receipt differences year over year.  We decreased taxes significantly for corporations, significantly for low to middle class (yes, it's temporary, yes, that's an issue)... but our gains in tax revenue mirror previous year's gains, and if the stock market is any indication 2018 has been a giant step backwards economic-growth wise compared to other years.

"You are correct, in 2017 54% of American's owned stock.",L
But OP is right about who owns the most stock. Almost 90% of the stock is owned by people who make $100K or more.,L
Only 54%? Jesus... this has to be a financial literacy issue... I've owned stock since I first started working part time back at the age of 18..,C
"Well, I suppose it was probably shortly after that as I didn't start a 401k until a few months later. But still.. does nobody plan for retirement?",L
"I bet you made a lot more money at 18, when adjusted for inflation, than most 18 year olds are able to make nowadays.",C
$9.25 an hour is what I made. Roughly 20k a year. That was in 2009. Indexing through 2017 based on CPI would be about 17.6%. So the 20k I made would be worth $23520 rounding.,C
$23520/52 weeks/40 hours is $11.3 per hour. Minimum wage is 11.25 in the current market.,C
So it is pretty close,C
Where is minimum wage $11.25?,C
"Minneapolis. It is scheduled to increase as part of a recent bill. I think it will be $12 next year. Not entirely sure. But it is $11.25 in minneapolis, unless you work for a company will less than 100 employees. Small companies are allowed to pay a lower minimum wage. I don't know the exact number off the top of my head. But I can find it if you would like. It will be in my recent search history. I had to look up the $11.25 lol. I'm salaried so I don't get paid by the hour. Wish I did though, I work a lot of OT without pay...",C
"Most 18 year olds don't make enough to plan for retirement, I know I didn't make enough to start on my 401k until I was about 22/23.",L
"It isn't like there is an income requirement to start a 401k. I suppose fees could be an obstacle, but that's getting way to far into the weeds for me to want to discuss.",L
"I was making $9.25 an hour at the time and still setup my 401k. It was a tiny contribution of course, but I still got started.",L
There is no requirement but you have to have the extra money to contribute. A lot of people live bare minimum paycheck to paycheck and are unable to do so.,L
"I lived bare minimum, paycheck to paycheck. Still was able to put 2% aside knowing it would grow and benefit me.",C
"This is what I mean when I say financial literacy is a problem. Budgeting, investing, planning for the future. This is how you make a better future.",C
Financial literacy should be a part of the core curriculum in our grade schools.. at least in high school..,C
"If you had 2% to put away then you had more than a lot of people. You seem to think because you were able to do something, than everyone else should. This is not the case.

$7.25 in Wisconsin....,L
The fact that I could at that age with that little leads me to believe that there are many many people who could do the same and chose not too.,C
I planned for retirement once.  Then my job got sold out from under me and I still needed to pay rent.,L
Are you advocating that people don't plan for retirement?,L
I don't understand your point.,L

Confused? Lol.,C
"I've lost my job as well. Planning for retirement didn't hurt me and planning for retirement didn't cause me to lose my job. I wasn't able to invest normally while I was job hunting, but I found another job and then continued where I left off.",L

Don't worry about it. You clearly have everything figured out.,L
Lmao. Not even close my friend. I'm only human.,L
But you should open a 401k immediately if you have the ability and haven't already. It will only benefit you.,L
"Ok, so working to middle class people are included in that, depending on location.  Is there a problem with it?",C
100k is working class where exactly?,L
San Francisco.,L
"According to many sources such as business insider, that would be middle class in San Francisco.",C
And that floor starts at ~70k.,C
There seems to be a disconnect (not surprised) between working class and middle class.,L
"In any high cost of living area, like the other poster said.",C
"The point is, these are tax cuts for the middle class and working class. Yes, wealthier people will also get some cuts to them, but that’s not the primary focus.",C
"I think the statistics cited above actually show the reverse (90% owned by the wealthiest 13% of people, only 54% of people own stocks total). Yes, middle class people will also get some cuts, but that's not the primary focus.",L
"The wealthiest 13% definitely includes the middle class, who own stock for retirement and college funds. Any working class people with pensions or 401ks are also invested in the market.",L
"I’m not going to argue that the upper class doesn’t have more money or more income. However, if you cut taxes for the middle, you also cut for the upper.",C
Edit for clarity: this is all because the rich pay most of the countries taxes.,L
"The issue I'm taking with your statement is ""focus."" If we took the 13% highest paid people in the country and put them in a room then you'd still have the vast majority of the middle class existing outside of that room.",C
"That is the sentiment being expressed here, that these stock buy backs did not create a great deal of wealth for the middle class. Yes, that 13% includes some members of the middle class, but that doesn't refute the fact that it helps the upper class disproportionately more and that these tax breaks are NOT a solution to generate wealth in the middle class.",L
"In most places that's not working to middle class, those places are a small minority in the US.",C
"So we’re in agreement: working class some places, middle class everywhere else.",C
"We're not, 100k in most of the US is not middle class. The median HH income in 2017 was $61,372. You're using a minority to reflect the majority.",C
"It's a fact that the majority of the stock in the US is owned by the 1%, which is the point of this discussion.",L
"That only works if you make up your own definition for middle class. It’s not defined by median income or majority status, it’s defined by job type, income, and education.",C
"Middle class includes skilled trades, lower to middle management, and the professions (law, medicine, pharmacy, engineering, etc).",L
"correct, a quick google search shows 54% of Americans currently own stock (down 12% since great recession), more relevant is that the top 10% now own 84% of all stocks. A majority of us owning at least ""some"" stock in an IRA, 401k, or college savings account sounds great until you learn all of those accounts combined equal only 16% of the entire stock market not already owned by the uber-wealthy.",C
"Also worth noting, an estimated 1/3 of all US stocks are foreign owned. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/10/24/the-asterisk-that-accompanies-the-gains-in-the-stock-market-a-third-of-the-shares-are-owned-by-foreigners/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.cd1b5133e3a3",C
Might want to peak at the markets on occasion.  Owning stock is not helping anyone right now.,L
"except it isn't ""cycled back into the economy"". The top 10% don't change their spending habits the way that the middle class does when their income/wealth  increases. The multiplier only works if the windfall is spent.",L
"The only person who can ""create a job"" is a customer",L
It gets shuffled around to other speculative instruments mostly. Largely it doesn't do anything until it's used to commission an order to employ capital or labor. We haven't really seen evidence that that is happening.,L
"What do you thinks happens to the money that is returned to shareholders? It does not cease to exist. It either gets spent on stuff, used to repay debt or reinvested in some way.",L
All three of those options would leave you subject to capital gains tax and thus are fairly unlikely to be chosen by the 1%.,C
This is a terrible understanding of how capital gains works.,L
The velocity of money is vastly different depending on which economic class is receiving the money. So your premise is not as correct as you are implying.,L
Funny how Reddit loves to pin the blame on people keeping their money and not The Federal Reserve which is the biggest wealth transfer from the middle class to the rich. In this case by keeping interest rates low (and even lower for banks) they’re able to borrow at low rates and buyback stock while savers are punished.,C
Of course they trickle down Who do you think this money went to?,L
I'm confused. Do you not think a company can both buy back stock and invest in infrastructure?,C
Corporate money is finite. Money spent in marketing cannot also be spent in Salaries.  Where a company puts this money is a good indication of its priorities.,L

"And the markets are still crashing.  Literally enough money to give every man, woman and child in America $8000 - has now just vanished into thin air because the President has no awareness of the world beyond his fourth chin.",C
This comment is impressive in its sheer ... ignorance,C
Money does not vanish into thin air.  It gets reinvested in different investment vehicles.  Maybe you've noticed interest rates have been rising recently.  That makes bonds and CDs more attractive to investors than previously so they shift some of their money from stocks into bonds.  Hence the decline in the stock market.,L
"Eliminate any tax breaks that are not helping the economy. Eliminate the FED as it was made by the richest americans in the early 1900s to control the counties wealth and always have ahold on the government as the government pays interest on its own money. Bring back the high income high taxes, only way to have any tax breaks is directly to help your local community or education institutions.",C
"My company had rafts of stock buybacks this year after their big tax windfall.  It's now midway through Dec and no pay adjustment for moi, not even a COLA.  Fuck supply side economics (more specifically tax cuts for the wealthy)",L
The money that your employer used to give you a bonus and raise was not taxed (it was a business expense and ultimately income tax for you).  Any money your employer decided NOT to spend on expanding operations or raises is now taxed at a radically lower rate.,C
Your employer gave you a raise in spite of the tax cuts. The tax cuts incentive keeping profits and not reinvesting them.,C
"Thats nice, but people seem to lack a basic understanding of cause and effect and attribute it randomly",L
"I got a huge pay increase and a new job,  but that doesn't have anything to do with tax cuts.",L
Although I do see the economy looks a little shakey despite these tax cuts,C
And then lets say the tax cuts did result in my good fortune. Was it worth borrowing from the future because these tax cuts don't look sustainable. Probably not.,L
Tax cuts without a way to pay for them are irresponsible and are not good for the economy longterm.,C
You've been purchasing US goverment bonds? because otherwise no it isn't your money.,L
"Yes, I have, it’s part of my IRA. But the money is mine. I earned it. Giving less of it to the federal state or local government makes me happy.",C
Either way it is bad for the economy. Inflation may eventually make all of YOUR MONEY have less spending power.,C
"The Fed is responsible for the spending power of our money, but that’s a different discussion, for another time.",C
So are you saying that there are no consequences to cutting taxes without a way to pay for it? Might as well just make them zero and boost all of our spending too.,C
"I would have no problem with making income taxes zero. If the government wants tax me, it should be on my usage of their product, not a random % of my income.",C
So you avoided my actual question.,L
How would you like me to answer it?,L
"With a yes or no, maybe details and reasoning too. Not sure why you need your hand held on that. So are you saying that there are no consequences to cutting taxes without a way to pay for it?",L

You must have read comments after every excessive force accusation or unarmed shooting by an officer where people always go well he should had listened, he shouldn't had done this or that. Some people really worship police and see them as they can do no wrong. Until that large voting block wakes up, then not much will change. Best we can hope for are laws to change these things. Which will always be an uphill battle.",L
"This voting block is there, but the good news is that it seems to be slowly decreasing. Even some conservatives I know are now starting to question police overreach in this country.",L
"If the people on the right side turned out in bigger numbers, things would be very different.",C
So we have to wait another 25 ish years until all those old shrews are dead I guess.,C
I both disagree and agree with you.,C
"Prosecution freedom is absolutely necessary so politics/social outrage do not drive what should be an impartial and systematic process. If their deals and reasonings became public then there will be outrage every time a deal was struck because ""we literally do not have the resources to bring this to trial"" which is an unfortunate reality, and defendants would be less willing to strike deals if all negotiations would become public.",L
"However, we need changes. First, prosecutors are currently heavily incentivized to get convictions for pay raises, promotions, and the ability to get into higher paying offices. Maybe bar the use of conviction rates for hiring. Second, the necessary business relationship between prosecutors and their local law enforcement makes it difficult for prosecutors to go after officers for crimes. After all, prosecutors need cooperating police officers to function, and if the police force refuses to play ball then the prosecutors are going to have a hard time getting convictions. I think each state needs a prosecutor office that exclusively prosecutes crimes committed by law enforcement to resolve this problem.",L
"It's called a special prosecutor and it needs to be used every time a police officer is charged.  Local prosecutors can not, for reasons already mentioned, be objective or fair when prosecuting their own police force.",L
I agree with this. Why should we give them bonuses for doing their job and without the police retaliating by not doing theirs. If they do so and prohibit justice then they should be fired and face obstruction charges. Just ridiculous.,C
You have a really good grasp of this complex issue. You offer some realistic solutions that will likely never see the light of day.,L
"Prosecutors are basically cops, and once they decide to charge a normal citizen, that citizen is f’d, regardless if they’re convicted.",L
"Most people don’t understand this aspect of getting caught up in the system. It is designed to grind you into pieces, make you unemployable and strip you of both reputation and money.",L
"If you didn’t have those things to begin with, then you’re going to jail.",L
"Once they’ve decided to prosecute, the notion of your guilt or innocence does not matter. It is inconsequential to the machine.",L
Prosecutors should not be allowed to represent or prosecute LEO.  There should be a special court for it in each state.,L
"""police the police""",L
"But prosecutors have to work with the police, and maintain good relationships. That's why they're so eager to cut deals for crooked cops, assures the cops at large that they're on the same ""team"", even if they HAD to punish one of them this time. So we could fire this prosecutor but the next one will probably work to establish just as cozy a relationship with the cops as the last one.",C
We need to overhaul and rein in the powers of prosecutors.,C
I love how you think you still have any ability to do so in USA. Thats cute.,L
Add a couple of zeros and you'll be closer to the real number,L
Shit like this just attracts crooks to become cops.,C
Any wonder why every thinking person hates the police?,C
"And this is why the NFL players kneel. Police accountability is good for everyone, but people are too tribal to be rational.",L
"Dixon's 12-month jail sentence has been suspended, providing he complete therapy and treatment, and avoid unsupervised contact with unrelated minors.",L
Doesn't sound to me like he was innocent. Did you read it?,L
There was apparently no physical evidence.  It's usually pretty hard to secure a conviction without it. Especially on a cop.,L
"Exactly. They couldn't make the case, so they agreed to a guilty plea on a misdemeanor (contributing to the delinquency of a minor) with suspended sentence as long as he cooperates with the limitations and requirements. If they had proof he was sexually abusing a minor (which the same misdemeanor can also refer to), they wouldn't have stuck with just the misdemeanor and would've pressed further charges.",C
"He's not innocent, he pled guilty to a crime, they just couldn't prove he was guilty of more severe crimes. Pretty much the only thing to complain about here is the potentially lenient treatment he got for the misdemeanor (which carries a punishment of up to 12 months imprisonment and/or a fine of 2,500 dollars), and that kind of thing is common with guilty pleas.",C
It's usually pretty hard to secure a conviction without it. Especially on a cop.,C
"The ""Especially for the cop"" is what OP was referring to. It should be no more difficult or easy to convict a cop than a regular citizen.",L
"The primary difference is that ""average joe"" is not necessarily going to get a good lawyer. Union cops WILL have a good lawyer. So while the sentence includes the word ""cop"" it really is associated with the likelihood that a cop will be poor (which is close to nil). Any rich person who has zero evidence against him is much more likely to beat the charge in court, and often they will settle for a tiny charge plus time served to avoid trial/jail being even remotely possible.",L
So in essence it's already no different trying to convict a cop than anyone else in a cop's income bracket. With the caveat that cops are not poor and often have a union with lawyers to back them up even if they are mediocre cops.,L
These people literally operate on another plain of reality. Fucking sick.,L
The problem is how many people make excuses for them. They can kill someone in cold blood and millions of right wing idiots will defend them blindly.,L
"This isnt something they can defend without making themselves look like perverts, so they will have to face reality this time.",C
i’m sure their repentance is coming any minute now,L
"Fuck that. Getting angry is productive, and is a great motivator. Everyone should be gloriously enraged at this bullshit.",L
"Getting angry is only productive when it's properly channeled, but yes - I agree with you.",C
If that was true why accept a plea deal at all?,L
Something like 90% of cases end in plea deals because the defendants don’t want to go through the costs and time of a trial. That should never be a question.,L
The article also says he plead guilty for delinquency of a minor in exchange for no jail time.,L
"The article is light on details, but seems to indicate that there was no evidence that he possessed any child pornography.",L
"A sheriff's captain who was originally charged with distributing child pornography has pleaded guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor, receiving no jail time in turn.",L
The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports 40-year-old Donny Lewis Dixon entered in a written agreement Wednesday to be convicted on the misdemeanor charge.,C
He was arrested in June after investigators executed a search warrant. But defense attorney Peter Baruch says there was no document or image showing his client possessed anything illegal on his computer.,L
He plead guilty for a reason.,C
"If it was a slam dunk case of a child predator, they didn't have to plead him out with no jail time.  The prosecutor agreed to a sweetheart deal for a reason, too.",L
The DA agreed to a sweetheart deal because he's on the same side as the cops - the side that protects dirty cops.,C
And why do you think that reason has nothing to do with his profession and/or how well he knew the DA?,C
He's not playing by the same rules as everyone else. Simple as that.,C
You suggested “no evidence.” Someone doesn’t throw their career away with no evidence. I never suggested a “slam dunk.”,L
"Who said he threw his career away? He's a cop, he can murder if he wants and just get hired in another city.",C
After a nice paid vacation,L
The prosecutor agreed to a sweetheart deal for a reason,C
"Yeah, the reason being he's a cop.",C
"Then why bring charges at all?  Why not quietly have the matter go away?  No one ever had to know about it at all, prosecutorial discretion could have been exercised to choose not to bring charges.",L
Why not quietly have the matter go away?,L
And just what do you think giving a charge like that will do?,C
He is a sex offender that will not have to register as a sex offender.,C
He is a police officer who was not fired from his job.,L
"He is a criminal who will not have a criminal record (the charge he was given is easily removed after probation, as long as he doesn't have similar offenses (which he doesn't since he was a police officer) on his record.",C
"At least there was one cop with balls, the man who took him in.",C
"I'm not sure why they chose to pursue charges, but this will not effect this man in any meaningful way. Hell, he'll probably be able to return to the force in about a year.",C
"""If you've got nothing to hide, why won't you let me search your stuff?""",L
"""If you're innocent, why are  you pleading the 5th?""",L
"""If you're innocent, why do you need a lawyer present? Just tell us what happened""",C
"Additionally, it's most logical to accept a 100% chance to 6 months in jail versus a 30% chance of 6-10 years",L
Contributing to the delinquency of a minor is the go to charge when there is little to no evidence in a child abuse case. It's basically the DA saying they need to charge you with something to put up a W on their record and you can either take the plea or roll the dice on a jury that might convict you in spite of the lack of evidence.,C
*pleaded guilty,L
Dafuq is plead guilty for past tense?,L
"""pled guilty"", surely?",L
Pled guilty is accepted though more colloquial. Pleaded guilty is standard and more official.,C
“Pleaded” is the standard. “Plead” and “pled” are considered non-standard but within common usage. I’ll be more careful next time.,L

Roger that. Sorry buddy.,C
From another article:,L
"After Hanover County Sheriff’s Office investigators executed a search warrant at his residence, Dixon was charged with one count of possession of child pornography, according to a news release Saturday from the Sheriff’s Office",L
"They probably found it on his phone and are sticking with the ""nothing on his computer"" to make him look good. Cops can do anything, even distribute child pornography, and not get in trouble. Hell, this pig resigned. He wasn't fired. I'm sure they told him he would have to be let go if he didn't resign. Giving the nice way out to a guy who jerks off to lewd photos of kids (and shares them). Awesome.",C
"There are two completely separate charges here: possession of child pornography and distribution of child pornography. If you see child pornography online and click ""share"" you are guilty of the second. (And yes, I have seen child pornography on Facebook. It was shared almost a million times by idiots thinking they were someone helping before it was taken down. It makes me literally sick.)",C
"Another example, I walk over to you and give you a USB drive containing child porn. You turn around and give it to someone else. You are guilty of distribution of child pornography, not the possession of it.",L
u mean the cops inestigated a cop and found no evidence!?,C
seems to indicate that there was no evidence that he possessed any child pornography.,L
"From the excerpt you quoted, it seems to indicate that the DA gave him a sweetheart deal because they are colleagues. And you cannot take a lawyer's claims at face value; I mean, this dude is trying to argue for a cop that was distributing child porn.",C
But defense attorney Peter Baruch says there was no document or image showing his client possessed anything illegal on his computer.,L
"That's very specific wording. The attorney did not say that child pron was not found on the computer. He is claiming there were no documents or images describing the defendant possessing anything illegal. So, they didn't find a document or image saying, ""I have child pornography."" That doesn't mean that they didn't find child pornography.",L
Yeah I thought the same thing.  I want more details on the case.,L
"So the police ""didn't find anything"" and he was offered a misdemeanor charge. Yep, not the least bit suspicious or corrupt",L
Police in America are Above the Law,C
Wow! His defense lawyer says he didn't do it?,L
I wonder why he plead guilty...,L
"His defense lawyer claims he didn't have any kiddie porn on his computer. This doesn't mean anything because he was charged with distributing child porn, not possessing it. He could have given it away on a USB stick or emailed it to someone, or shared it online from one website to another website.",L
It is revolting that he is not seeing jail time.,L
"He could have given it away on a USB stick or emailed it to someone, or shared it online from one website to another website.",L
Literally just supposing shit to fill your narrative of how the world works now?,C
He was arrested for distributing child pornography. This is a separate charge from possessing child pornography. It is just as disgusting. Where do you think people get child porn? From others who distribute it.,C
"The fact that he doesn't have anything on his computer means nothing. He transferred child pornography somehow, maybe by forwarding an email, who knows. We would have to see the affidavit or more details about the case to know.",C
"Wow! His lawyer says he is innocent. News at 11. They must've had some legit evidence to execute a search warrant, no?",L
"A sheriff's captain who was originally charged with distributing child pornography has pleaded guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor, receiving no jail time in turn.",L
"He pled guilty to a different, but entirely related, crime.",L
Baruch says the legal teams avoided a trial by agreeing to something that didn't involve sex offender registration.,L
This is just prosecutors looking out for cops.,L
They gave him the time to bleachbit it.,L
nothing on his computer does not mean his phone and tablets were clean .,L
on his computer,L
it was probably on a phone or tablet or something else. devil is in the details,L
Based on what? Based on the fact that he was arrested means that he did it?,C
based on the fact that they specifically said computer rather that possession in generation. you don't understand the importance of words  you sad naive idiot,L
"He probably also had Polaroids, HD-DVD's and VHS's of the stuff too huh? They didn't specifically rule those out either",L
"Peter Baruch, Dixon’s defense attorney, said there was not enough evidence to support a felony prosecution in the case. The defense attorney also said there was no document or image produced during the proceedings that showed his client possessed anything illegal on his computer files.",L
Strange that he would plead guilty to a lesser charge if there was no evidence against him.,L
"Right? It's one thing to plead guilty to a lesser charge to avoid a trial, but if there's literally no evidence of what you're being charged with, there's no reason to plead guilty to a lesser charge.",L
Lawyers cost alot of money. Pleading guilty can save you literally hundreds of thousands of dollars even if you didn't commit a crime,L
"Sounds like a sweetheart plea to a lesser charge for pig, while i bet anyone else would have gotten the book thrown them.",C
The only thing pigs protect is themselves,L
What in the fuck? When will law enforcement start policing themselves?,L

FUCKING NEVER,L
"We were actually talking about this last night, the town next to us had a ton of officers arrested and serving jail time for things like running a prostitution ring and selling drugs they had confiscated.

"Arrest doesnt mean guilty. That's how our judicial system works. If you wanna burn him at the stake for an accusation, move to Russia.",C
"True, an arrest doesn’t mean guilty. Pleading guilty means guilty.",C
What did he plea guilty to?,C
"A Class 1 misdemeanor, the most severe classification in Virginia law. 'Contributing to the deliquency of a minor', which in Virginia can mean two things:",C
"Willfully contributes to, encourages, or causes any act, omission, or condition that renders a child delinquent, in need of services, in need of supervision, or abused or neglected; or",L
"Engages in consensual sexual intercourse or anal intercourse with or performs cunnilingus, fellatio, or anilingus upon or by a child 15 or older not his spouse, child, or grandchild.",L
"If it's number 2, additional charges will likely be filed because those are felony offenses in Virginia, and the misdemeanor is basically the cherry on top.",C
"So, given the lack of information in the article, one of two things was happening here. . .either the defendant was doing #1 and causing someone of that age range to be 'delinquent' by the abovementioned definition. . .or it was actually #2 but the prosecutors felt they had insufficient evidence to make it stick and wanted to find the guy guilty of something. Considering the following from the article ""Baruch says the legal teams avoided a trial by agreeing to something that didn't involve sex offender registration."", it's very likely #2 was in play and the prosecutors agreed to a plea deal because they had some evidence of more serious crimes but not enough to ensure conviction. We don't know for sure, as the article doesn't specify.",L
"That being said, he got lenient treatment by not immediately having to serve prison time, instead getting the 'treatment and restrictions' route initially. Ok, sure, he's not necessarily guilty of having sex with someone between the ages of 15-17 years old, but he still copped to a serious misdemeanor charge and should serve time. They're already doing him a favor by not dragging his name through the mud in court with the possibility of losing a felony defense, but throwing this on top of it. . .bleh.",C
My ass it does. Some people would rather go to jail for 3 years for something they didn't do than risk life in prison if they plead not guilty and are found guilty anyways.,C
"That may be. But in the most literal sense, pleading guilty means guilty.",L
True but he is not guilty of possession or distribution of child pornography as his plea deal does not include those charges.,L
"From a legal standpoint, not necessarily reality.",C
Yeah but he didn’t plea guilty to distributing child porn.,C
Delinquency of a minor includes a lot more than just giving them booze in Virginia. Here is the actual law;,C
"Any person 18 years of age or older, including the parent of any child, who(i) willfully contributes to, encourages, or causes any act, omission, orcondition which renders a child delinquent, in need of services, in need ofsupervision, or abused or neglected as defined in 16.1-228, or (ii) engagesin consensual sexual intercourse with a child 15 or older not his spouse,child, or grandchild, shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.

READ THE ARTICLE yourself. He was charged with distributing child pornography.,C
"He is not charged with possessing child pornography, which is a separate crime. His lawyer is just trying to make him look good and look like he does not collect kiddie porn. The fact of the matter is, he illegally distributed kiddie porn in some manner, whether it was via CD, USB, email, web etc. He transferred child porn from one place to another.",L
"Charged with. Not found guilty of. Please show me into the article that he ""for a fact"" distributed. He plead guilty to delinquency of a minor. Not the same at all. Plus, a suspended sentence means that if he doesnt do the therapy, then he does go to jail.",L
He got nudie pics from a minor and forwarded them on. That's distribution of child pornography. He pleaded down to delinquency of a minor by enticing the teen into sending him nude images.,C
most people charged with distributing are using p2p filesharing.,L
they're easy to bust b/c all the cops have to do is set up a honeypot p2p client and log some data from a local IP address and go arrest whoever it is.,C
"depends on the state but they don't always get jail, especially if they have no prior record",L
a lot of them don't even realize they're distributing; p2p is just magic to them,L
So why did he plead guilty?,L
"not a cop because he resigned, he wasn't even fired. funny how far people will go to defend a fucking pedophile just cuz he wears a a badge.. well, used to wear a badge. either way it's pretty pathetic.",C
"People are saying the plea deal is the result of collusion between the Sheriff and the DA, but I don't think they realize these kinds of plea deals are commonplace in child abuse cases.

Private prisons will also PUNISH people who refuse to do the work when ordered to do so.,L
"That's actually one of the reasons a lawsuit challenging these private prisons has met with some initial success (survived a motion to dismiss).

"Just a reminder that these people are not in prison, nor have they been convicted of a crime",L
"It's especially important to note this because, contrary to what many people believe, ICE detains many people who entered the country 100% legally, including people with green cards, people who overstayed visas, and asylum seekers who arrive at ports of entry. ICE is actually required by law to detain asylum seekers who legally present themselves at a port of entry and ask for asylum. These people can be held for months, even years, while their asylum case is worked out.",L
"For example, one Haitian asylum seeker, Ansly Damus, was detained for two years and only released last month. He went to the port of entry in Tijuana and asked for asylum, then was transferred to detention center in Ohio and held for two years, despite winning his asylum case twice (he was detained while the government appealed) and being denied parole repeatedly. He was a schoolteacher in his home country who had never committed any crime, and broke no laws in the United States, and was nevertheless locked up at taxpayer expense for two years.",L
"A high number of asylum-seekers and ""collateral arrests"" are the main reasons that the majority of people in ICE detention are not criminals. In fact, a snapshot of all 44,435 people detained in ICE custody on June 30, 2018 showed that 58% of people in ICE detention had no criminal record, another 21% had no criminal record higher than a minor offense like a traffic violation, and only 16% of people in ICE detention had been convicted of serious criminal offenses.",L

Many other US prisons use their cheap workforce to manufacture products for external contracts. Does anyone know if the detention center's $1-a-Day labor is used for things like that?,C
"Not implying that it makes things worse or better than the ""cleaning toilets"" example used in the article, I'm just curious.",C
"IIRC, it's legal in the US to use felons as slave labor (and I consider $1-a-day slave labor,) but I'm not sure that applies to everyone that's detained pre-trial, much less asylum-seekers awaiting due process. I would hope not.",C
"IIRC, it's legal in the US to use felons as slave labor (and I consider $1-a-day slave labor,) but I'm not sure that applies to everyone that's detained pre-trial, much less asylum-seekers awaiting due process. I would hope not.",C
"Yeah, that's the main difference! People working in jails/prisons for incredibly low wages can be paid that little largely because they've been convicted of a crime, which gives them seriously lower constitutional protections. As you note, the Constitution even explicitly allows slavery to be a punishment for criminal conviction (the Thirteenth Amendment bans slavery and involuntary servitude ""except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted""). But ICE detainees are not being detained because they've been convicted of any crime. They're technically ""civil"" detainees.",L
I am against the use of practical slave labor because quite frankly it's just another angry divide between wealthy and penniless inmates.,C
Hence why ALEC pushes so hard for harsher drug laws. Got to get that labor.,C
https://www.thenation.com/article/hidden-history-alec-and-prison-labor/,C
"ALEC helped pioneer some of the toughest sentencing laws on the books today, like mandatory minimums for non-violent drug offenders, “three strikes” laws, and “truth in sentencing” laws.",L
Said it before and I'll say it again:,C
The war on drugs is a scam and a farce.,C
"I'm confused on this, why are they being detained for any length of time?",L
"You either put them in normal prison for violating us law, or you deport them",C
They should be paid the minimum wage of whatever country they are a legal resident of.,C
Or paid the minimum wage of the country they're in right now.,C
"If immigrants - even illegal ones - are required to be paid minimum wage, that completely undercuts one of the main reasons employers use undocumented immigrant labor over legal resident/citizen labor.",C
"I'm wondering if you realize that it is perfectly legal to come to the United States, surrender yourself at the border and plead for asylum - and until that case is heard, they are not ""illegal aliens"" because they have not been convicted of entering the country illegally.",L
"Conflating people requesting asylum with people intending to evade authorities is pretty bad too, so why are you calling them all illegal immigrants?",L
Huh? Where did I do that?,L
You literally just said I was conflating people requesting asylum with illegal immigrants up there^,L
What indicated that to you?,C
"In case you've completely missed his point, people in ICE detention include both illegal immigrants and asylum-seekers (also, people with green cards). Therefore, by saying that ""this is a prison for people who break the law,"" you were conflating people requesting asylum with illegal immigrants.",C
Conflation means the merging of two groups. I am criticizing your merging of people seeking asylum with people seeking illegal entry into the US for the purpose of undocumented residence.,L
"From my understanding of the U.S. constitution, slavery and other usual human rights violations are only legal for people who have convicted of a crime and received due process. This shouldn't apply to people being held before a trial in an ICE detention center.",C
"In the USA, you can be a slave if for something as trivial as stealing a pack of chewing gum, but you sure as hell need to have gone through the legal process and actually convicted first. It doesn't seem like these people have.",C
Asserting that's it's okay to give anyone (regardless of the allegations against them) the choice between being paid a dollar a day to do physical labor or being relegated to solitary confinement is an absurd logical fail.,C
"Further, despite your assertions, ICE detainees haven't been convicted of a crime, and illegal immigration is a civil infraction, much like speeding or disorderly conduct. You're conflating prisons and holding facilities to further your racist agenda. Very lame.",C
A conviction is one thing.,C
None of these people was convicted of anything.,L
We also don't know who they are or if they are dangerous. Hence why they are detained.,L
Yes you did,C
Nobody can take you liberals seriously,L
Ah the trumpie comes out,L
Its not and your assumption based on your response indicates you are not very knowledgable on the subject.  Do you want to do hard labor for jay walking?  Thats the level of misdemeanor we are talking about here.,L
That would be a false equivalency logical fallcy.,L
Jaywalking and illegal entry are not equivalent.,L
Its illegal entry onto a street. Not that different,L
Have you looked at immigration law before?  Illegal entry is a civil offence...,C
Maybe brush up on the topic a bit?,C
"Either you support the conduct of ICE here, or you don't. Your comment doesn't make any sense if you're trying to be critical of ICE so I have to assume you think it is appropriate to pay people one dollar a day.",C
"Next, I directly address a statement you made:",L
"""This is a prison for people who break the law. Entering the country illegally is a crime.""",L
"ICE detainment centers are not prisons. Pointing out your lies is not attacking a strawman. Moreover, illegal immigration, much like other civil infractions like speeding or dis con, cannot result in prison time. Making a comparison is not attacking a strawman.",L
Listen your them vs us mentality has rendered you unable to reason. Fact is I never said it was acceptable for them to pay people a dollar a day for forced work.,C
Accept that.,C
Also accept that criticizing a misleading headline or deceptive story is ok. That does not make me a bigot and undeserving of civil argument.,L
Further you are the one who is lying with the claims that illegal immigration is a civil infraction it is not.,C
"It's a federal crime, absolutely punishable by prison time.",C
In your own words,L
Illegal entry is a federal crime a misdemeanor for first offense and a felony for re-entry after deportation. Not a civil infraction.,C
https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/a70c2f/exice_official_paid_to_defend_1aday_wages_for/ebzdsi9/,C
None of these people have been convicted of anything. Do you just not give a shit about due process?,C
So? What is your point?,C
So they shouldn't be subject to conditions like they were.,L
"No, you defended everything that ICE is doing, while being completely ignorant of the things you are supporting.",L
"ICE will make you work for $1/day, or they will put you in solitary confinement.  Nobody in ICE custody has been convicted of a crime.  Non-citizens are protected by the Constitution whenever they are in our country or subjected to our government.",C
"These people's rights are being trampled on, and you don't care because you hate Latinos.  You would never admit to such a thing, because doing so would mean admitting that you are a racist, but that isn't a surprise to any of us, because it's quite typical of full-throated supporters of ICE.",L
Bla bla bla assumptions that make the pleasure center of your brain light up with righteous moral indignation.,L
"Playing the race card only shows yourself to be a racist. Try to think outside of your one sided mind. None of their rights are being violated, and CBP has a duty to find out who they are and if they are dangerous. It would be asinine to not detain them.",L
Cool. Where they convicted?,C
Certainly plenty are. If they already entered illegally they should be charged and convicted. Then there's the whole catch and release situation and these states that refuse to cooperate with their justice dept refusing to prosecute and you got the shit show we have now.,L
Unless they have a genuine cause to seek asylum and economic reasons is not enough they won't be eligible and they should get sent back.,L
The lack of convictions on these illegals is a separate but related problem.,C
"Still a ridiculous plan to avoid paying Americans min wage even if someone were to agree with what you are saying, which I mostly do.",C
"Yes I agree with you on that, the prison should be swiftly deporting the detainees and not using them as slaves.",C
"These are the same detention centers that Asylum-seekers are held at, so you are objectively wrong.",L
This is a prison for people who break the law.,L
"That is patently false. ICE detention centers hold tons of people who came here legally, including people who arrive at ports of entry and ask for asylum (the law requires that people who ask for asylum at ports of entry be detained) as well as people with green cards that the government is seeking to deport.",C
"Immigration detention is legally ""civil"" detention, not criminal detention. If they were being held in criminal detention ironically they would be entitled to a whole lot more rights, because people being charged criminally have a right to a lawyer, a right to a trial by jury, etc... which immigration detainees do not have.",L
Headline is misleading. This is a prison for people who break the law. Entering the country illegally is a crime.,L
Have they been convicted? If we're charging them with a crime (as you put it) then they're entitled to due process regardless of citizenship. That's how our county works. There's a lot of precedent showing that our constitution (including the 4th) extends to anyone within our borders. It's the reason Trump has had a hard time with some of his orders.,C
"If they haven't been convicted, they're entitled to a fair (federal min) wage if they're being asked to work.",C
Right and I never made any claims defending that aspect of the story. Only that the headline deceptively conflated illegal immigrants with all immigrants.,C
OP didn't change the original headline.,L
Removed dig at OP.,C
Now go read about the difference between a crime and a civil statutory violation,L
Illegally entering the country is a federal crime a misdemeanor for first offense. Re-entering after deportation is a felony. Having been convicted of other crimes will result in harsher sentences.,C
Whatever disinformation you have is of course false.,L
"Misdemeanor, got it.",C
"People seeking asylum are in the clear so long as they make an attempt to present themselves to authorities, and that does not have to happen before 'gaining entry' to the nation.",L
Obviously that means that any legal infraction related to entering the country without documentation is not particularly serious.,L
"You are also wrong again, it's only a misdemeanor if the migrant has already been deported in the past. For most people without documentation it is only a civil infraction, which is not a crime at all.",L
Wrong. Misdemeanor followed by felony for re entry after deportation.,C
Stop spreading false information,L
Its a civil misdemeanor.  Reread the doj article.  Its not disinformation.  Read the law or stop spewing lies.,C
A misdemeanor is criminal. a civil offense is an entirely different lesser crime that isn't even handled in the same courts so yes its disinfo.,C
Jaywalking is a misdemeanor,L
The headline is verbatim you jackass,L
Its deceptive and misleading.,L
Great ad hominem attack.,C
OP using the copy/paste function does not make the headline any less misleading you jackass.,L
Conflating a misdemeanor with serious crime is an absurd logical fail.,L
Guess you wouldn't complain if you're pressed into $1/day labor next time you get a speeding ticket?,L
You also cant be deported for a speeding ticket. It's almost like some crimes are different than others so have different consequences.,L
"Yeah, speeding is more harmful to the public than crossing the border.",L
When we dont know who is crossing the border that's very dangerous.,C
Then maybe throttling the processing of immigration claims and outright turning people away isn't the way to go.,L
Or maybe the US is in charge of our own immigration policy. If the US slows the processing if cases or tightens guidelines for security we can. That doesn't justify anyone in breaking the law to illegal cross. And asylum seekers cant overwhelm ports of entry then whine they arent all processed in one day.,C
"Because the majority of the people in ICE detention aren't ""Illegal Immigrants"".",C
"If you come to the US seeking asylum, you enter ICE detention, sometimes for years, without ever being accused of a crime.",L
"If you are going to be given an employment opportunity in this country, it must offer federal minimum wage.  What ICE is doing is illegal.  $1/day is insulting, no matter what the job is.",C
Any source on the majority of people in ice detention not being illegals? Seems kinda crazy.,L
Also jails and prisons usually dont pay people minimum wage. Not saying its right just an fyi.,C
"A snapshot of the 44,435 people in ICE detention on June 30, 2018 shows that 58% of people had been convicted of no crimes at all, and another 21% had no criminal record more serious than a violation.",L
"It's probably not true that the majority of ICE detainees are people who asked for asylum at the border, but that's a large portion. Asylum-seekers who ask for asylum at the border are actually held in ""mandatory detention"" during their asylum hearings, which can last months. However, given that the snapshot showed that 43% of people in ICE detention were Central American, that suggests that close to half of all people in ICE detention are asylum seekers, though of course some entered illegally and then turned themselves in before asking for asylum.",L
/u/throwawaynumber53 answered Part 1.,L
"As for Part 2:  People who are convicted, and imprisoned can be hired for below minimum wage.  However, ICE detainees have not been convicted of a crime - their incarceration is procedural, not a punishment.  It's EXTREMELY important to remember that.",C
"So, in your opinion, all they have to do is “seek asylum” and automatically be legal?",C
"No, I think that they could become asylum seekers, who will either be granted asylum or deported.",L
What the fuck is this fixation on framing these people as criminals?,L
If they are criminals then they aren't people. That's why we decapitate Jay walkers,L

"Apparently following the US's own laws to apply for asylum is a ""loophole""",L
US corporations can massively reduce their tax burden by shifting income overseas. Is that a loophole or not? The corporations are simply following US laws.,C
"The US minimum wage is based on the cost of living for citizens who need to pay rent, buy food, keep the lights on, etc.",C
"No, that’s actually laughable. How would that even work? On a federal level it would be impossible to find a wage suitable for, say, both California and Alabama. Even on a state level you could not find a way to make that work between, say, Redding, CA and San Diego, CA. You could do that on a city by city basis but the only cities that I’ve heard even consider instituting their own minimum wage is LA and Seattle and I don’t believe either ended up committing.",C
"Working 40 hours on minimum wage qualifies you for food stamps in America which means that taxpayers subsidize the wages of employees like Walmart who, apart from needing federal aid, also generally live paycheck to paycheck in order to afford basic costs of living like food and rent.",C

Honea says that many teachers have asked for the district to provide them with self-defense training.,C
Which they should get and be allowed to use.,C
It starts with the parents...,C
(Swaglfar i'm using you as a spring board so no direct offense meant),L
I'm sure I'm about to get verbally clobbered for saying this but....  Sometimes kids do stuff their parent(s) don't want them to.  Even stuff that's the opposite of how they were raised.  Per chance y'all could recollect your own experiences as a teen and how often you did what your parents asked.,L
"My intent is not to defend these parents if they haven't done anything to address this type of behavior.  However it just seems a bit dishonest of us to paint these things this way.  It can't be that parents who parent (assumed in the statement) are bad for restricting their children (the ""poor deprived children"" cause their parent[s] won't let them do X) but the same parents who don't parent are bad for letting kids do what kids want to do...  Maybe its just me that sees this as hypocritical.",C
"That said, you can usually tell how a kid was raised by how the parents react to stuff like this (i'm assuming that kids will do stupid stuff).  The ""my poor innocent baby"" versus ""tough love leave them in jail"" type of reaction.  Part of good parenting to me is letting your kid experience the repercussions of bad choices (i.e. hit a teacher go to jail with the previous understanding that doing so is a bad thing).  I would guess that more discipline / instruction would equate to a higher percentage of not doing ""bad"" stuff but there's always the outliers and just plain ole human behavior.  The opposite is probably true as well.  From the article linked there's not much to go on as far as the parents are concerned but maybe more will come to light.",C
"And I'll second your opinion. I've got a soon to be 11 stepson. His biological father is/was a wife beating, child beating, born again Christian. Fucked that boy up by four years old. I've been raising him since 4.5, but no matter what therapy, meds, or help I try, the kid has his father's ""it's your problem, not mine"" attitude.",L
And now he's in a school district with other kids whose parents don't care and has peers that feed off and feed into his issues.,C

ELI5: Why did Reddit users make thug a bad word and what is the best word to describe a hooligan now?,C
Asshole.,L
It just works.,L
Good in all situations.,L
"Usually the news will just say ""teen""",L
Groups like Fox News started using the term every time a black person committed a crime. If they had used this to describe white or hispanic criminals as well then it wouldn't have been as bad. Instead they kept up the rhetoric to scare old white people and give them a new term to use instead of their old familiar slurs.,C
"It's not just Reddit users, and this post is not a good example of using thug inappropriately. People get mad when a black person minding their own business gets called a thug, which happens ALL THE TIME.",L
"In fact, it happens so much that the word has taken on a racist connotation now. And I understand that it may sound silly when a perfectly harmless word is suddenly un-PC, but the truth is, this is not a new phenomenon.",C
"Harmless words became taboo way before we were born, and it will continue long after we die. It's not a liberal thing. It just happens.",C
"People get mad when a black person minding their own business gets called a thug, which happens ALL THE TIME.",L
When does that happen? I only encounter the term in these Reddit threads.,L
"It's a used pretty extensively, e.g. to deride rappers, and I've seen it used commonly to describe unruly black basketball players when white players who do the same thing are ""scrappy""",L

Hooligan still works.,L

"I think if we try, we can take that one back.",C
Because Reddit users love finding new reasons to get their panties in a wad.,L
Thug is a perfectly acceptable term to describe the dickhead in the article.,L
Oh. Simple.,L
Because thug somehow became associated with race so it became a racist term.,C
It’s sort of like how “bossy” became a sexist term because little girls were being called bossy a lot. There is nothing sexist about the concept of “bossy”. But now people aren’t allowed to say it.,L
"And I’m left thinking, “if you don’t want your daughter to be called ‘bossy’ then maybe help her stop being so bossy.” Little boys are bossy too and it’s just as bad.",C
Because racist assholes refer to every black person that does something shitty as a thug now.  So it has taken on a racist tone.  They will not refer to a white as a thug in the same sentence.,L
"It's pretty obvious too, just look at the comment section of news article and you can even predict if the crime was committed by a black person just by the number of thug comments.",C
"The bossy comment is the same idea.  I've never heard anybody refer to a male as bossy, it's always females so it became a sexist term.",L
You've never heard someone say a man is bossy?,C
That's just silly.,C
Boys aren't called bossy. They're future managers.,C

"This must be an Americanism, Thug just means Thug over the pond. Codifying language as offensive or non-offensive is just pointless.

"Not really. I offer no solution because I don't have one. Therefore, I don't seek a position that puts me in charge of making those decisions.

Notice how Devin Nunes starts attacking and attempting to discredit the investigation into Flynn just before this is announced when he got real buddy-buddy with Flynn and the Turkish Foreign Minister during the transition.,L
Wonder why Nunes had to have someone else view his own intel information for him (Gowdy)...,L
"[edited: there was speculation at time that Nunes lacked clearance, cant find confirmation]",L
Really? I thought Nunes was the delivery boy for the Putin/Trump back(front?) channel. I’d assume he would have been granted a security clearance just like Trumps son in law. I’d love to see that dude get locked up.,C
"Trump's son in law had trouble getting clearance, too.  If I remember correctly, he left most of his security clearance application blank, then used temporary clearance for like 6 months.  Right around when John Kelly became chief of staff, Kushner lost his clearance for a while and the story broke that the White House was illegally abusing temporary clearances because a bunch of them couldn't get cleared through the proper channels.",L
"Nah, he only had it downgraded for a few weeks. All of it was a political stunt anyhow. Trump, unfortunately, can overrule any recommendations for clearance approval/denials.",L
"Wow, so many witches have turned up in this supposed sham of an investigation!",L
One side did pass and FBI investigation...,C
Huh its almost like the investigation isnt over and the general public dont have access to the information held by the prosecutors,L
I'm sure those going  to jail are going to take great solace in that.,L
and yet still no charges of Russian collusion,L
"You know what I find interesting?  This is pretty much a no win argument, because even if there was evidence, the goalpost would quickly would quickly shift to (and has in other cases during this investigation when it cut too close) ""You can't serve an indictment to a sitting President, that's Congress' job.""",L
"But then if Congress did that job its, ""Oh it's just the Dems being butt hurt, this whole thing is fake.""",L
It's just difficult to convince anyone of any fact when they so willfully wish to be ignorant.,C
being footed by the taxpayer.,C
Reminder that the investigation has recouped more money than it has spent.,L
This statement is categorically false and willfully ignorant.,L

"Dude the press got kicked off the fifth floor of the federal courthouse. They also convened all 10 federal judges in DC which is highly irregular. All so ""someone"" could secretly fight a subpoena? Big stuff is happening guy. You can deny it all you want.",C
"And multiple times we've learned of where that happened.  From WikiLeaks work with Russian officials, to Trump tower in Russia needing special permit from Putin and those are just a few choice ones.  Mueller has brought all of that to surface through the indictments he has handed out.",L
No charges to date in relationship to the purpose of this special investigation,L
"If you don't see how the two I pointed out contradicts you comment, then there's not a discussion to be had.  (See: willful ignorance).",L
which is being footed by the taxpayer,C
"This is the dumbest crap I hear people bring up.  Who fucking cares?  Our government (that's both teams, so don't feel so hurt by this statement) does stupid shitty budgeting crap at Usain Bolt pace.  Suddenly, everyone is feeling like a budget hawk on this?!",L
All the rabbit trails Mueller is chasing could have been handled without a special council.,C
"And?  So what?!  The DOJ felt that this was the way to go instead.  There's a million things the government does I don't agree with on a second by second basis.  I feel the special counsel was indeed appropriate, but whatever, I get that not everyone agrees with that point.  But no matter what path was taken, we'd still be in this crap where the base screams ""unfair"" and ""witch hunt"", so results would be exactly the same as had a special counsel been appointed.",C

Glad to see this Republican led kidnapping plot wasn't just buried and forgotten about. Maybe Devin Nunes will be the next of those involved to be indicted.,L
Also should mention that Trump is still working on doing this to shut up Erdogan about Khashoggi murder,L
"Why is it a ""Republican kidnapping plot""?",L
Because several Republican members of Congress were apparently involved.,L
https://www.businessinsider.com/devin-nunes-michael-flynn-turkey-russia-2017-11,C

"Daryl Issa was making the rounds saying the Flynn case was going to be thrown out today based on the FBI ""tricking"" him.",C
"Of course, the only places I can find mention of it are all the ""real news sites"" like freedomeaglepatriot.info and taxesaretheft.biz...",L
It's not a crime to conspire about the kidnapping of a US resident?,L
https://www.wsj.com/articles/mueller-probes-flynns-role-in-alleged-plan-to-deliver-cleric-to-turkey-1510309982,C
"Under the alleged proposal, Mr. Flynn and his son, Michael Flynn Jr., were to be paid as much as $15 million for delivering Fethullah Gulen to the Turkish government, according to people with knowledge of discussions Mr. Flynn had with Turkish representatives. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has pressed the U.S. to extradite him, views the cleric as a political enemy.",L
"Federal Bureau of Investigation agents have asked at least four individuals about a meeting in mid-December at the ‘21’ Club in New York City, where Mr. Flynn and representatives of the Turkish government discussed removing Mr. Gulen, according to people with knowledge of the FBI’s inquiries. The discussions allegedly involved the possibility of transporting Mr. Gulen on a private jet to the Turkish prison island of Imrali, according to one of the people who has spoken to the FBI.",C
"Because, he's been cooperating with the special counsel a lot.",C
Then why charge him with lying at all?,L
"They were going to charge him with more, unless he cooperated.  So they charged him with something really small as part of the ""plea agreement"" where he signs and agrees to cooperate.  This is pretty standard.  There can be plea agreements where they are not charged with anything but judges often do not like that because someone ends up getting nothing for breaking the law.",L
Could not tell you why as I lack information on that,C
Is it possible that there wasn't sufficient evidence to support the allegation against him?,L
Sure that's possible! It's also possible that before they make the more serious charges public they're going to make him name names and give them any info he might have forgotten about anything or anyone. Lying to the FBI is a serious crime for a reason. Edit: they'll give him a chance to plead down to the lesser charges.,L
"No it shouldn't.  The FBI records ""perfectly legal"" conversations all the time.  The sole purpose was not to ""catch him in a lie"".  This isn't entrapment.  I can't tell if you are being sarcastic or actually believe what you are posting.",L
How would the FBI know beforehand if a particular conversation would contain no illegalities?,L
"Maybe we need a system so that judges okay the tapping of phones. Oh I forgot, that’s how it already works.",L
Edit: this is the right answer to the wrong question (this is a general intelligence surveillance question not a criminal investigation question). See the right answer to the right question below.,L
That system is supposed to keep the American's identity secret. That's how it's supposed to work.,L
"Nobody is claiming Flynn's conversation was illegal, but he was being spied on by the FBI... the incoming National Security Advisor...",C
It's absolutely mind-boggling.,L
It’s precisely because he was the incoming National Security Advisor that he was treated differently (and rightly so):,C
The text below is from https://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-administration/319890-yes-eavesdropping-on-flynn-was-the-legal-obvious%3famp,C
"While different minimization procedures apply depending on the legal authority under which the government conducted the surveillance, as a general matter, the procedures require that a U.S. person's name be redacted and replaced with ""(U.S. Person)"" to protect that individual's privacy.",C
"However, an exception to that rule is if the U.S. person's name is necessary to understand the foreign intelligence information or assess its importance. Flynn's identity was essential to understanding why his conversation with Kislyak was important.",C
That's terrifying.,L
"They had the transcript of his perfectly legal conversation. Why would they hide that fact from him? Why not tell him ""We taped your conversation and have a few questions we would like to ask you""",C
Why ask that he not have a lawyer present?,L
Maybe because they are looking for information on things and want to make sure he is being honest with them...,L
"It's not like military man of his rank who was director of the DIA wouldn't know that lying to the FBI was a crime.  All he had to do was go in and tell the truth.  Gee, I wonder why he didn't...",C
It's not going to stand one way or the other. There was no crime until the FBI advised him not to get a layer then interviewed him about information they already had.,L
"Stop being terrible, Republicans. Is that so hard?",C
"There are different levels of terrible, though.",L
The one stabbing you in the back is generally more liked by the public versus the one stabbing you in the belly.,C
If you think it’s only the republicans that are terrible,C
A republican president is planning on extraditing a legal US resident so that the government of Turkey will back off Saudi Arabia's killing of a journalist (who was employed by an American network that is critical of the Trump presidency). How terrible does this look?,C
"So you are saying we cannot be critical of Republicans because, ""Democrats do bad stuff too""?",C
Ahh “both sides”. The calling card of a freshman in college pseudo intellectual,L
This is patently false. It's an attempt to muddy the waters.,L
"I'm not going to have a tough time. Cute of you to be concerned for me though, babes.",L
Yesterday it was reported that Turkey's foreign minister said they were working on having Gulen extradited from the US. People theorized that Turkey by gradually leaking info about Khashoggi is pressuring Trump to give into demands on this in exchange for stopping info on Khashoggi. Trump is in turn pressured by Saudi Arabia to defend Mr Bone Saw which makes the leaks a bit inconvenient.,C
It sounds very plausible to me.,L
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/16/turkish-foreign-minister-on-gulen-extradition.html,L
And yet supposedly this administration is working on giving him to Turkey anyways.,C
"Yikes! More and more continue to be caught up in this massive anti-republican witch hunt. Say it ain’t so, America!",C
"Why do you call it an ""anti-Republican witch hunt""?",L
"I'm assuming they were being facetious. But maybe not, hard to tell these days.",L
I usually check their post history if their sarcasm is vague.  That usually has indications of their true intentions.,L
The current administration is looking to extradite him. So that conspiracy may have worked in the long run.,C
It may be that some of those involved with the conspiracy against the USA are still in government,C
"Used to be that registering as a FARA agent was nothing that DC got excited about.  Bob Dole did, as a foreign agent for Taiwan while the Podesta brothers did not when working as agents for Ukraine.  Now, it is taken more seriously.  I think that's a good thing.  Working on behalf of another government is not necessarily a bad thing, but we should all know the motives of those who do it.",C
edit; typo,L
"No Russian collusion but so much criminal activity against the US, its like these guys don’t have much love for the country.",L
Let's not act like Trump fired him because of this.,L
"I mean, Trump is currently trying to finish the job.",C
Who says we aren't?,C
"But Mueller's team also noted in a sentencing memo earlier this month that Flynn also made false statements to the Justice Department related to work his company did ""for the principal benefit of the Republic of Turkey"" soon after the 2016 coup attempt",L
"Trump's transition team was involved in this as well, just ask Devin Nunes.",C
"So you're just going to ignore the fact that trump was warned by obama, yates, and several others before and after the inauguration about his being compromised and he decided to completely ignore them?",C
"The lying is just a bad excuse trump made up to try to cover is ass that he ignored the warnings of an at the time sitting president, attorney general, and congressmen about him.",L

The mother accused of leaving her two daughters in a car for about 15 hours last June was sentenced Wednesday to 40 years in prison.,C
"“This is heartbreaking and distressing,” said Judge N. Keith Williams. “The most compelling piece of evidence was the slow and painful deaths these children endured — with cramps, headaches, seizures, anxiety and wondering ‘where’s mommy.’”",L
"Williams sentenced Amanda Kristene Hawkins to 20 years in prison on each pair of counts in two separate cases — one case for each of her daughters, Addyson Overgard-Eddy, 2, and Brynn Hawkins, 1.",C
"While the pair of terms for each case will be served concurrently, Hawkins must serve the terms for each separate case consecutively.",L
"Hawkins pleaded guilty in September to two counts of abandoning a child, causing imminent danger of death, bodily injury or physical or mental impair- ment; and two counts of injury to a child, recklessly causing serious bodily injury or serious mental deficiency — one for each girl.",L
"Williams also positively ruled on a deadly weapon finding, filed by the District Attorney’s Office, which had argued that the car the girls were in was used as a tool that caused their deaths.",C
"At some point on or between June 6 and June 7 last year, Addyson Overgard-Eddy and Brynn Hawkins were left inside a black car outside a home in the 2900 block of Riverside Drive, according to police reports.",C
"That night, Hawkins, 20, and a group of friends were smoking marijuana in a small shed outside the home.",C
"Brynn Hawkins was taken out of the car and sat with the group while they were smoking, according to testimony released during the hearing.",L
"The girl was eventually put back in the car. Later, a 16-year-old, later identified as Kevin William Franke, slept with Addyson and Brynn in the car, but left.",C
"People reported hearing the girls crying, and someone told Amanda to take the girls out of the car because it was too hot.",L
But she reportedly told them “they’ll cry themselves to sleep.”,L
"Temperatures reached 85.6 degrees at 11:35 a.m. June 7, according to hourly weather observations recorded at the Kerrville Municipal Airport for the National Weather Service.",C
"By noon, when the girls were retrieved from the vehicle, the temperature inside the car would have been about 119 degrees, according to a vehicle interior temperature scale formulated in a study by the San Francisco University Department of Geosciences.",L
"Hawkins did not immediately take the girls to the hospital, according to testimony.",L
"She bathed them and searched on the Internet how to treat heat stroke, said John Hoover, assistant district attorney for the 216th District.",C
"A few hours later, she and Franke took the girls to Peterson Regional Medical Center, where she told staff the children were smelling flowers at Flat Rock Park and collapsed, according to reports.",C
"The girls, who were transferred to University Hospital in San Antonio, were pronounced dead about 5 p.m on June 8.",L
"Daniel Gebhard, a physician in charge of the pediatric intensive care unit at University Hospital, said doctors thought the girls had been poisoned, so they were going for that course of treatment.",L
But he had a feeling it wasn’t the full story.,C
"“I told her it wasn’t quite adding up, and asked her if there was anything else she could tell me,” Gebhard said.",L
"But Hawkins never did, and it wasn’t until he talked to police that Gebhard was able to piece together what happened.",C
"“It was a busy day, in general, that day. Everyone else in the unit had a story that made sense,” he said. “This one didn’t.”",C
He also said Hawkins appeared to be detached and was on her phone.,C
"That behavior was something Lana Benavides, a nurse at the pediatric intensive care unit, also noted.",C
"“She was not engaging. She spent the majority of her time on her phone and not making eye contact,” Benavides said.",C
"And as Addyson Overgard-Eddy was dying the next day, Benavides wrapped her in a blanket and gave her to Hawkins for one last good-bye.",C
"“She looked everywhere but her baby. She looked at the ceiling, the wall and at me, but she wouldn’t make eye contact with her baby,” she said.",C
"Hawkins’ lawyer, Kurt Rudkin, called on her mother, grandmother and brother to testify. They all said she was an adoring mother who loved her children.",C
"“They were clean and well-fed,” said her mother, Alisha Eddy.",C
"And Sally Smithson, director of Young Lives, a local nonprofit that serves as a resource for teen mothers, described Hawkins as “interactive” and “patient” with her daughters.",C
"Hawkins’ parents divorced while she was in jail. Growing up, she was described as a “daddy’s girl,” but that all changed when her father got a job in Africa while she was in middle school and only came home twice a year.",C
"“That took a big toll on her. That’s who she looked up to,” Alisha Eddy said. “She needed her dad in her life.”",C

But she reportedly told them “they’ll cry themselves to sleep.”,L
"From the viewpoint of a parent as well, I don’t think she got enough. 40 years in jail for murdering her 1 and 2 year old children is no where near enough.

"If she had taken the kids to the hospital immediately it may have helped with the sentence considerably.

"The car probably got hot in the morning with the windows up, so the time she wasted running them under cold water and googling was very important to their survival. The doctor may sort of be eluding to that as well.",C
My guess is the doctor did not have nice things to say about her choices when she had some chance of saving her kids and the judge interpreted that as something like 2nd degree murder.,C
Do you actually think she accidentally left those children in the car through an entire night and morning?,L
"What I'm saying is that the judge thought she wanted them to die and thus actively murdered them by car, and not just that she was an idiot who thought they'd be fine in the car.",C
"No, the judge never stated that and the charges she was convicted of and her sentencing are not based on that. You’re just making things up now and ignoring the verdict the case actually had.",C

"She was convicted of the same crime other parents see for leaving their child in the car. The big difference in this case is usually this is something that happens due to forgetfulness, or something that happens because they are intending to be quickly back.",C
"In contrast there’s testimony that she actively knew the kids were in the car and made mention of them at the party and fully intended to abandon them in the car through the night, saying “they’ll cry themselves to sleep”. Theres testimony that the length of time she abandonded them for in a car was 15 hours. There’s also testimony that she actively resisted seeking medical care for hours after discovering them in severe distress citing she was concerned for herself.",C
"Of course the judge went for the maximum allowable sentence, this is the most extreme version of this crime, negligence to an unfathomable level. She didn’t intend for them to die, but she did intend for all the negligent actions that killed them.",L
I wanna throw up and I beat myself up if it seems like my kid was up before me in the morning and possibly felt upset or something.Just how can they turn their inner voice off like that. I'm gonna assume diapers and car seats were involved too. Also cry them selves to sleep? Wow I didn't think people actually did that .,C
"I doubt she has the same “inner voice” that most people especially loving parents have. She’s just a narcissistic, selfish, shortsighted woman whose own disgust for personal inconvenience is only overshadowed by her utter disregard for the lives, feelings and overall well-being of others.

She would have to suffer at least the same fate if not even worse maiming and torture before being allowed to die, right? Human children though?

What if we make it so the Car will sound an alarm if the Car Detects kids are still inside the Car X hours after the Car is turned off?,C
Surely hours is even a bit too long.,L
"Indeed.  In summer time, death is within a few minutes.",C
Death is not within minutes.  It still takes hours.  The car will get very hot within minutes though.,C
"Infants do not thermoregulate the same way adults do.  Death is much quicker for them, unfortunately.  The two year old might last an hour, but not the 1 year old.  At least if I correctly understand what sources I've read.",C
Could you share those sources?,C
This would be great but any weight in the back at all or just you and friends in a car would sound the alarm too,C
"Something like this is actually used for police k9 vehicles where if the system is on and the inside of the car reaches a certain temperature, the horn will sound very loudly until it is turned off.  Some of the vehicles even have a sign on them with a phone number to call if you happen to notice the alarm going off.",C
"I have always thought that this seemed like such a simple and obvious solution to accidental deaths from forgetting children in the car— alarms on the seats or even just alarms in baby’s car seat. It seems so inexpensive, and like it would have such high consumer demand, that the only reason I can think of that it’s not in place is that no one wants to open themselves up to the liability. They must have weighed whether the liability if it fails vs. the increase in profits isn’t worth it, which is a shame. As someone who auto-pilots on my commute and works long hours, this is a fear of mine.",C
Note though it wouldn’t have helped the kids here. The mom in this story did not tragically forget her kids. This was intentional.,L
"I don't sympathize with her but I understand why people would. She is a young attractive teenage mother who just finished high school and still had her whole life ahead of her but is now going to prison for 40 years. I mean c'mon, that sucks.",C
"But then you hear about what she did before, during, and after and that's when you should've realized that this person is a danger to society and completely deserves the 40 year sentence.",L
She robbed two lives in exchange for a night of drugs and sex.  Everyone knows to not leave kids in a car unattended.,C
What does attractive have to do with any of this?,C
Studies show attractive women garner more sympathy in courts and often face shorter jail times than an uglier woman if they commit the same crime. Biases are biases unfortunately,L
And then there’s men...,L
And then there's black men ...,L

"Everything. Like with business or the game of Life in general, being good looking gives you a higher advantage. So a jury would probably be more sympathetic towards her which is sad as hell.",L
"I mean, you couldn't at least just walk over there and check them ever hour or two? At the very least? You weren't partying on the penthouse, you were in a shed near your car and didn't check on the kids once while SPENDING THE NIGHT in a shed partying with kids. Must be a hell of a shed.",C
"I do not understand the first degree murder charge on the 16 year old.  He slept in the car with the kids, rolled up the windows in the morning and took the keys inside.  Was he responsible for their deaths?  His actions contributed but first degree murder seems like a stretch. He wasn't trying to kill them, likely trying to keep them safer in a ridiculous way.",L
"He probably lied at some point trying to cover his ass and so they pushed for the higher charges. He did roll the windows up in the morning as the heat was building, which oddly enough was probably directly responsible for making a bad situation a deadly situation.",C
He was pretty careless to either not know kids were in the car or not understand rolling the windows up was going to make the temp rise in the car exponentially fast. He was probably cold in the morning and just did what felt natural without thinking about the other helpless life forms in the car.,C
BUT.. who knows.. you'll have to ask the DA.,C
Yeah like.. even a child knows you can’t leave a dog in a hot car with the windows up. A 16 year old should definitely know better.,C
Charged doesn't equal convicted. A plea deal will likely get that reduced. Hopefully he can afford a decent lawyer.,C
Honestly I hope he fights it and gets aquited altogether. It's a bullshit charge so some DA can make a name for him/herself instead of actual justice which would have been the appropriate charge from the beginning.,L
If I was 16 I really don't know what I would have done in that situation otherwise.,L
"That kid probably had his own mother worrying about him. Could be a little drunk or smoked a little bit, do we expect him to call the cops to his friends house and get a bunch of his friends in trouble for having a hunch that the kids would be left in there the rest of the afternoon.",L
"While leaving them in a cold car overnight is still neglectful, point being is that the 16 year old probobly left 2 healthy kids in that car when he left the scene because it seems like he left in the morning before it was hot.",C
I would expect him to not shut off the car and roll up the windows and abandon an infant and toddler to be cooked in a car.,L
"No, I certainly don’t expect him to call the police, but I do expect him to remove them from the car and bring them inside.",C
He went back inside though and gave the keys to the mom. It’s the moms responsibility at that point...,C
"hes 16,  If an adult says the kids are OK in the car, I think its understandable he believed her.",C
"He lives in a state where it is itself a crime to leave a car you were operating with children in it under the age of 7. Whether or not some idiot stoned girl at the party says it’s okay is immaterial, the second he got into the car and turned it on he had a legal responsibility to either stay in the vehicle with them or remove them from it. This is not some little known standard, it is widely promoted in schools and society in general in Texas that leaving kids in cars is tantamount to killing them due to the heat there.",C
"Think of it this way, if you see an unattended toddler in a yard it’s not illegal for you to carry on your merry way and do nothing. But it would be illegal if you picked up that child and then placed them in the middle of an active roadway and then walked away. You actively did something to put them further into harms ways.",C
From a legal perspective that’s what he did when he took custody of the car with them in it and then closed it up and shut it down in a way that would exacerbate heat increases and further increase the risk of harm.,C
"Was the car on the whole night he slept in it, or did he just turn it on to close the windows? I kind of doubt the car was left idling with the air con on all night",C
"In this case, would be more like joining the kids in the roadway for a while, then leaving before traffic got bad. He was willing to be in a similar situation as the children, just didn't consider how it would change over time or that the mom was so neglectful they would be there all day",C
do we expect him to call the cops to his friends house and get a bunch of his friends in trouble for having a hunch that the kids would be left in there the rest of the afternoon.,L
Yes?! Or at least bring them inside. The fuck kind of question is that? A 16 year old knows the dangers at play here.,L
Is this really how little we expect of people now?,C
You assume he knows everything about how long the kids were there and how long they were going to be there. It's a really tough situation for someone who's still a kid.,L
"Maybe he barely knew the mother, I don't know how I would feel about picking up someone's kids I didn't know. It's tough with little information.",C
Just to jump in here...,C
"My assumption is that the prosecutor has interviewed the witnesses and suspects and has more information than we do. I'm not ignorant of the fact that prosecutors sometimes inflate charges for their own gains, nor do I believe that prosecutors are infallible. But we sometimes read news stories and conclude that criminal charges are either excessively lenient or excessively harsh without having all the information.",L
I agree - based on the very limited information available to us - that a charge of capital murder for the 16-year-old seems excessive. But debating the issue without all of the facts is problematic.,L
"Is good point, this is why you always give the accused the benefit of missing information. Innocent until proven guilty is important.",L
"If you were an accomplice to a crime that results in death you can be charged with the same homicide charges. He was party to the criminal negligence of leaving these children unattended, therefore he was party to the homicide.",C
"Right, but so was ANYONE she told in the shed or on the phone or on facebook to some degree.",C
"The people in the shed beside this 16 year old could have walked out there and fixed this situation too. Plus anyone else at the house where this shed must be located? I assume some adults own a house and these younger people are using the shed as their bedroom/house, which is often not legal in an of itself.",L
I'm sure there are more crimes going on at the party shed residence than just this.,C
It’s about what you can prove to a jury. It’s a lot easier to prove negligence for someone who was physically in the vehicle than it is for people who had no direct interaction or knowledge of the situation.,C
"There’s a good chance he pleads down to a much lesser charge, but I doubt he avoids a conviction altogether",L
"But he’s being charged with first degree murder, not negligence.  It seems like his behavior warrants criminal punishment but first degree murder?",C
"Texas doesn't really have a true ""First degree"" murder charge. He is charged under Texas statute 19.02(Murder).",L
One of the conditions applicable for this charge is:,L
"(b)(3)commits or attempts to commit a felony, other than manslaughter, and in the course of and in furtherance of the commission or attempt, or in immediate flight from the commission or attempt, he commits or attempts to commit an act clearly dangerous to human life that causes the death of an individual.",L
"The indictment argues that the act of abandoning children while turning off the engine and rolling up the windows was itself a felony criminal offense, and since they died as a result of this felony crime it meets the standards for 19.02 as laid out in (b)(3)",L
Thanks for the explanation!,L
"This is a crock of shit. You're 16. Unless you lived under a rock im sure you'd know better than the 20 year old parent that you should at least keep your windows cracked for a dog, let alone a human life. Between news, television, movies, social  media, he knows better  and you guys are kidding yourselves if  you think otherwise. He put the final nail in the coffin, and i dare him to defend it like he had no idea. Any prosecutor would eat him alive.",L
"They said it was 89.  Was this 89 outside or 89 in the car.  You shouldnt have an issue with 89 degrees.  But if it is 89 outside during the day and the car is getting any sun light it will get to 140+ very quickly if the windows are up.  Infrared light from the sun (just like those red heating lamps) passes through normal car windows and hits the objects inside where it is absorbed causing them to heat up.  This heats the air but since the windows are up the heat can not escape.  It is a one way process.  This process does not take hours, it takes minutes.  Even a 60 degree day can cause some issue with this.  This is why yo need to put temperature sensitive things in the trunk as it will stay approximately whatever the outside temperature is.",C
"Even if the car was climate controlled nicely you still can not leave a kid strapped in a car seat for 15 hours.  I assume they were strapped in.  This can cause blood clots and other issues.  Every year we hear about some hardcore gamer sitting in the exact same position without getting up for a day and being killed by it.  Beyond that it is a long time in a single diaper, even over night.  My 2 year old is in the car for 1.5 hours and get restless.",C
It does not sound like she forgot them.  She purposefully left them in the car.  I feel absolutely terrible for those unfortunate parents who honestly forget their kids one day.  They will torment themselves for life over it.  Sounds like this is not one of those cases.,C
19 when her 2 kids died because she was totally still immature and unfit to be a parent at the age of 16/17? Can we please please please finally start providing comprehensive sex education in schools and easy access to contraceptives? How many kids have to kill their kids before something finally changes?,L
"Did you read the article? She was inside of a shed at a party all night smoking weed and left the kids in the car. Woke up at noon, and had sex before checking on the kids. Then she tried to revive them with cold water, refusing to take them to the hospital because she ""didn't want to go to jail."" She was fully aware of her own culpability.",C
Nothing you said contradicts the above statement.,L
"I don't think sex education is the problem. It sounds like lack of empathy was at play here. Any idiot knows not to leave infants in a car for 18 hours in Texas, regardless of the reason.",C
Did you read the post you replied to though? They are saying she is not responsible and thus should not have kids.,C
"It's wishful thinking, but that's what they are saying. They think more education will correct stupid people. They probably have more faith in education than most people.",C
"It's a fair point because you only wind up educating people or trying, there is no real downside other than perhaps the better realistizating that education cannot always save you.",L
"Education often cannot overcome poor parenting because poor parenting is more or less a 24/7 effect and education is more temporary and more voluntary. Parents can dole out for most strict rules and punishments and have far more time to figure their kid out than teacher, it's just many lack the brains.",L
"The question is how to you convince stupid people to stop breeding. I believe this is not the first time the questioned has been asked and an overpopulated world would still like to know the answer, so it's worth saying occasionally.",L
"I always here about stuff like this but I grew up in a bumfuck town in a conservative state in the early 90’s and we def learned about sex and how it works and the results. Literally every state in America has a state mandated high school health course that covers sex. These are just dumb teenagers with bad parents. Don’t blame society, blame their families.",C
"I grew up in the dead center of the buckle of the ""bible belt"" and definately learned, in 7th grade, ""sex-ed"". I tend to agree that kids are stupid. I was a stupid kid. Did I take risks sexually? Sure. But I knew that if I came home and told my parents that I got a girl knocked up, they would f'n kill me. I knew this. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind. That alone was enough for me to ALWAYS use a condom.",C
"I also live in the Bible Belt and our sex ed was a basically a PowerPoint presentation with pictures of STD dicks right before lunch. That was basically it. A whole bunch of cauliflower dick. I'm pretty sure some of those had to be fake. Don't have sex before marriage, and don't masturbate either (because you'll set unreasonable expectations, apparently).",C
"Yeah, my HS sex education did not include things like “how to properly put on a condom”. It was more clinical/disturbing genitalia photos. It wasn’t anti masturbation or outwardly religious though (thank god)",C
"Don't have sex before marriage, and don't masturbate either (because you'll set unreasonable expectations, apparently).",L
You have to be master of your domain,L
Surely after the first one she knew?,L
"Not leaving your kids in your car on a hot day to party and smoke weed isn't about sex education, it's about common sense and being a responsible person. And there is more to it, because as a single parent with two young kids, getting shitfaced at any time would still be a problem, even if they weren't in the car - simply the fact that she can't attend to their needs while in that state.",C
"Her kids were 1 and 2 years old! They need food, clothes, diapers - she is responsible for that, and she failed at it so horribly, that those two tiny humans are now dead. Even after finding them unconscious, she wouldn't stand up and accept responsibility and call 911 - instead she tried to rescue them by flowing cold water over them.",C
Blaming sex education is laughable. Do you think these kids don’t know that you can have a baby if you fuck without a condom? They simply don’t care. Because sex feels good. We seem to think that more education can cure stupidity.,L
"Yeah, the whole abstinence-only education and stigmatization of talking about sex that permeates our whole judeo-christian victorian-era-leftovers culture isn't doing any damage whatsoever",L
My high school had comprehensive sex education and free condoms available at the nurses office. We still had teen pregnancy. It’s very possible for people to be dumb in spite of education.,C
"Hey I have an idea, let's tell kids that sex is evil and gives you STDs, that'll totally work, right? .....right?",L
We had real sex ed. How to put on condoms and everything and we still had two girls the next year get pregnant.,L
"we had sex ed in 5th grade, then again in middle school, then again in HS... This was back in the 80s/90s.  The county I lived in at the time still had the highest teen pregnancy rate in all of America.....",C
Not sure what OP is on about.  Murica tries to tell kids to be smart.  Starts with the family..,L
Government can't solve every fucking problem.,L
What? Did you read the article? What does this story have to do with sex education? She abandoned her children in a hot car.,C
I am all for sex education in schools but its not something that will stop everything. my school district in 11th grade had sex education (called health) but girls still got pregnant in 12th grade.,C
"So a fucking 16 year old slept in the car with the babies, didn't think anything wrong of it. Then he fucking rolled up the windows n left them to bake. Therefore own fucking mother abandoned them for like half a day, no diaper change, no one to comfort them, sitting straight up in a car seat. No fucking food. I hope this woman and that kid get the ever loving shit beat outta them in prison or juvie or something. Fuck them. Their parents must be fucking morons to instill absolutely no common sense in them by that age. I hate this fucking world we live in.",L
Their parents must be fucking morons to instill absolutely no common sense in them by that age.,L
"This is a woman that had two kids by 19 and goes ""partying"" (smoking pot in a shed) leaving them in the car.",L
It screams uneducated and poor social circle.,L
Some people really suck.,L
Jesus. Glad she’ll be infertile by the time she gets out.,C
Woah.,L
"The teen, [removed], is also charged in the girls' deaths with two counts of first-degree murder, according to court documents obtained by People.",L
"First, don't we usually not reveal the names of minors charged with crimes?",C
"Second, how/why was the teen charged with first degree murder? If anything the woman is responsible, not some stoned kid who didn't sign up for baby duties. And as disgusting as it is, what she did, it certainly doesn't constitute first degree murder. How does the kid get charged with in? I see that he rolled up the windows when he left, but that is only one small part of their deaths and it's not like he did it to intentionally hurt the poor girls. Not getting it.",C
"I would have said it was negligent, until she refused to take the kids to the hospital.  If your kids are having serious medical issues, and you're Googling solutions to stay out of jail instead of getting a doctor; that's a legal paddlin'.",C
"The teen I would guess was present when that decision was made.  He slept in the car with the kids, and left them in the car after.  Also it mentions that 19-year-old mother had sex when she woke up.  So it could have been with the 16 y/o teen.  They don't say.  But that kind of implicates the 16 y/o.",C
"I do not understand the first degree murder charge, the kids are not his responsibility, if they were gonna charge anything I would think negligent homicide or something.",L
It depends on how they are charged.,L
"If she is being charged as an adult (looks like that's the case here), their names can be released.",C
He’s 18 now so I guess that’s why they put his name in there,C
There is a special place in hell for this bitch. Seriously. And for anyone in this thread defending. My God what is wrong with people.,L
"Maybe if you want to party, you should wait a few years to start a family. Having two kids at 19 feels a bit early to me. I know its certainly not unheard of, but it seems to me based on the outcome here that they would have been better served putting off having kids (although no telling whether or not those kids were planned or not).",L
"Sucks to have ruined your life because you'd rather party than take care of your kids, but some people need to learn the hard way.",L
although no telling whether or not those kids were planned or not,L
Truly a mystery.,L
1st degree murder?... Were they able to prove that it was premeditated?,C
"Premeditation does not necessarily mean you spend 3 months planning it out.  All it means is that you had time to consider your actions.  If you punch me and I pull a gun and shoot you it would not be premeditated.  If you punch me and I walk to my car and grab the same gun and shoot you it could be called premeditated as I had time to walk away and return, even if this is 15 seconds.",C
A big hit on her is the fact that she refused to get them timely medical care when she knew they needed it.  She had two hours to think about it.,C
"Maybe I missed it, where in the article did it say 1st degree murder?",L
"I'm not sure how to explain where it is in the article, but it is in there.",C
"Found it, talking about the 16 year old kid who slept in the car",L
Thats one of those charges where the prosecutor must have been high on blow when they charged him.,L
"Ooookay but child rapists and attempted murderers get 5-7 years, drug dealers get 10-20..... our justice system is not systematic in any way...",C
attempted murderers get 5-7 years,L
"I mean she basically murdered two children, so...",C
This woman killed two of her own children...,C
Are you saying that murdering two children is a lesser offense to attempted murder?,C
If we use the logic of the ultimate crime being murder then sure murder > rape punishment wise makes sense.,C
Drug crimes being punished by jail sentences will never make sense to me because shit should be legal for adults. If it’s legal then no one commits a crime.,C
I don't know about you but when I was 17 I knew not to let human children cook in a car.,L
"Even at 16 I knew not to leave my little brothers unattended in a car, and they were a lot older and more capable than toddlers. And this was in the summer in Texas of all place, that state makes a big deal out not doing this because it is so dangerous with their heat",C
"16/17 yo are young adults and knows now yo leave kids in a car over night. Not only that but not to only way up the next day at noon, get fucked one more time and then head back to the car where you left your children.",C
Da fuck is the matter with you?,L
40 years??? But she had such a promising future!,L
I’m not sure charging the 16 year old is appropriate in this case.,C
"The children’s mother is to blame for the children’s deaths. The children should never have been left unsupervised, let alone unsupervised in a car.",C
"The 16 year old was ignorant and irresponsible, but not unusually so for a 16 year old.",C
"Even at that age I would have thought it weird and wrong to leave kids in a car that long, especially when the kids were already either dead or dying by that point.",C
"At that age, I probably would have thought that informing the mother of the children’s whereabouts was adequate.",C
There is a good reason I didn’t have children at age 16.,C
"I also didn't smoke pot in a shed...Oh, what a boring life I have led.",L
Fuck that dude . That kid was definitely aware of the situation  .,L
Charge the mom to high hell. But why the guy? How was that teenager any way responsible for those children?,C
He slept in the car so he would have known the kids were in there. He rolled up the windows before going inside. Rolling up the windows is what would have caused the temperature to skyrocket.,L
He gave the keys back to the mom. She should have immediately went to the car. Was also probably drunk and it high. So he possibly did not know children were in there. The mom could have put a blanket on them.,C
I’m just saying why he was charged. Whether or not he is guilty is for the jury to decide.,C
I don’t think I’m meant to understand some people...,L
This is why I'm pro-choice. Abortion is much more humane than slowly cooking to death in a car.,L
"My god, I wish I hadn't read that.",C
"If there was ever a case that argues for mandatory sterilization, this is it.",L
"I don't think manslaughter charges are fair. Losing your son or daughter, and the guilt that comes with knowing that was your responsibility, that's punishment enough. I wouldn't wish that upon anyone, let alone an additional charge.",C
"I really recommend that anyone who holds this opinion read this article, at the very least. It won a Pulitzer prize in 2010, and tries to show how this can happen to anyone. If you've ever left your wallet on the table, it can happen to you:",C
What kind of person forgets a baby?,C

"The wealthy do, it turns out. And the poor, and the middle class. Parents of all ages and ethnicities do it. Mothers are just as likely to do it as fathers. It happens to the chronically absent-minded and to the fanatically organized, to the college-educated and to the marginally literate. In the last 10 years, it has happened to a dentist. A postal clerk. A social worker. A police officer. An accountant. A soldier. A paralegal. An electrician. A Protestant clergyman. A rabbinical student. A nurse. A construction worker. An assistant principal. It happened to a mental health counselor, a college professor and a pizza chef. It happened to a pediatrician. It happened to a rocket scientist.",C
15 hours.,L
Because this case is an extreme example is no reason to say there should be automatic charges every single time.,L
"I don't think manslaughter charges are fair. Losing your son or daughter, and the guilt that comes with knowing that was your responsibility, that's punishment enough. I wouldn't wish that upon anyone, let alone an additional charge.",C
"I think you vastly overestimate how guilty someone who takes drugs, and has sex instead of watching their kids, then doesn't take them to the hospital right away so they personally don't get in trouble will feel.",C
"Also, this is nonsense of the highest order. Parents accidentally killing their kids is substantially worse than someone doing it to a stranger because they have a moral and legal duty to their protection. If feeling bad is its own penalty, we might as well remove manslaughter from the books and only charge intentional murders.",C
"And in how many of those cases were the children not forgotten but intentionally left behind so mommy or daddy could go party, get stoned, and work on making sibling number three? She didn't forget those kids. She left them on purpose. Completely different.",C
"That degree of self centeredness deserves the long prison sentence. I guarantee you, she doesn't feel guilty for the loss of her children. She cares that the party is over and she actually has to answer for her actions.",L
Marijuana my ass.  That's some methy behavior.,L
I hope this fucking bitch gets what’s coming to her. Sick as fuck and people like this should be tortured every second of their lives until they die.,L
"I don’t watch OITNB, how are hardcore female prisons like?",L
"If they find out what she did, would the other inmates beat her?",C
"If this mother had adequate access to contraceptives, perhaps this would not have happened.",C
And the banksters that caused misery for millions don't even get a slap on the wrist.,L
Our justice system is fucked. She should have got a minimum of 60 years.,L

I know.  So why even have a watch list?  It’s useless,C
Well if the person is suddenly buying a bunch of fertilizer or renting a truck you might be able to step in at some point before the act is committed.,L
Renting a truck isn’t illegal.  People have rented trucks to use them to mow down pedestrians at Christmas markets.,C
"I'm aware, but it's also not illegal to follow someone. At least in the US, I guess I don't know what French law is like. But if someone on a terror watch list rented a big moving truck I'd think it prudent to have someone find and follow them and intervene if they look like they might be trying to drive into a crowd or something.",C
Well they were on his way to arrest him that morning. This whole thing was a huge fuck up. Almost the same thing happened with the guy that killed those people in berlin 2 years ago.,C
The two biggest attacks in the past were both police fuck ups =/,L
They were on their way to arrest him for his beliefs?,C
I think they knew he was planning something and they found explosives (?) and weapons while at his house. So they could have arrested him on the spot.,C
"If they knew he was an ISIS-supporter and they found bombs and guns at his house, you'd think arresting him would be a higher priority than ""eh, maybe I'll get around to it after I finish binge-watching The Office for the 12th time.""",L

It’s a shame,C
"Then why the fuck have such a list? I can't imagine how demoralizing it has to be being stuck on an ""anti-terror"" group that's not allowed to do anything except clean up the body parts after the person you know is going to commit a terror act actually commits one. At some point, we have to realize that failing to police beliefs incompatible with the existence of our civilization amounts to surrender.",L

"That's some real 1984 shit, and I would say that thinking is just as incompatible with western civilization as anything ISIS has in mind (hint: policing beliefs is literally what ISIS has in mind). If we get to a point as a society where we're replacing terrorist watch lists with extrajudicial hit lists for thought crimes, I'm not sure that's a society worth saving.",C

Yeah see how that works and get back to me.,L

"U.S. State Department officials said in Congressional testimony that the State Department had wanted to revoke Abdulmutallab's visa, but intelligence officials requested that his visa not be revoked. The intelligence officials said that revoking Abdulmutallab's visa could have foiled a larger investigation into al-Qaeda.",L

Communists were all atheists (I suppose you could argue the ideal is it's own religion) and that has resulted in the deaths of millions.",C
So why is it always Christianity?,C
Usually the people making the argument are themselves Christian or live in a Christian majority nation so it's a glass house and stones situation.,L
"Also everyone always takes this argument the wrong way. When someone makes that point it is not to say that Chritianity is worse, it is to point out that judging a religon in such a reductionist way is absurd, and holding someone's religion against them is generally just discriminatory. There is too much variance within major religions to make such statements. You could do so with specific imams or mosques, or with specific churches like Westboro, but doing so with an entire broad religious category is awful.",C
"Don't you find lumping in people who ""live in a Christian majority nation"" with Christians more absurd?",L

"Just because the shooter was born in France doesn't necessarily mean they saw themselves as French.

Unlike their parents, most 2nd-generation have never actually lived in those homelands, and didn't experience the problems that led their parents to emigrate from them.",C
"Oh, yes, you're spot-on.  But the actions of the people around them - including strangers and so on - can have a bearing on what direction they go.  If the community around them welcomes them as French, they are more likely to consider themselves that way too.",L
It’s an actual issue 100%.  France is forced to surround their markets with concrete barriers and armed guards.  That’s costly and frankly wasteful.  And it’s the inevitable consequence of their massive immigration coupled with ineffective screening.,C

"So you're good with ISIS supporters living in Europe given their propensity to commit jihad at the drop of a hat if their day isn't going well?  I'm not.  We'll just have to agree to disagree.

Should we just accept Jihadi attacks as part of life now that we can do nothing about??  LOL.  The sleeping giant is awakening.  We're been distracted about what the real enemy is but we're figuring it out.  Especially the Christians.",C
"I genuinely disagree.  The giant isn’t asleep, he’s in a coma.  We continue to import these people with no effective screening.  And by we I mean the USA, France, Germany, everyone.",C
"Step one would be fix the screening.  I don’t think we can actually do that.  The president realized this, so he proposed halting immigration from these countries.  And that idea was shot down.",L
We cannot fix the problem until we stop making it worse.  And there’s no appetite for doing that.  Or not enough anyway.  The sleeping giant might as well be dead because he won’t wale up till it’s much too late.,L

"I would close the Christmas markets.  Even if you had one guard per patron, you cannot protect something like an open market.",C
And they will have to raise taxes and hire more police officers and more paramedics to respond to terrorism.  Probably need to buy more body bags and cemetery plots too.,C

"That’s what France will have to do.  They have no other options that i see.  I read the whole thread, there’s no good idea that can actually be implemented.",L
Why should anyone living in a peaceful society shoulder the burden of an increased risk of terrorism just because most migrants aren’t terrorists?,L
Why is it always Europe’s fault when migrants don’t assimilate?,L
The vast majority of immigrants DO integrate in society...our hospitals and factories and shops are run by them. You bundle them all in to one and you think not letting any in is a good idea? If you think Poland or Hungary are 'great' countries with amazing opportunities and benefits for it's people then why are there so many emigrating OUT of these two countries?,L
"The vast majority are irrelevant to this ongoing terrorism that has invaded western Europe.  ""But the Trojan Horse is a GREAT GIFT and Benefit to our society.  What does it matter what it brings with it??""",C
First of all I think you and most people in this thread are idiots. Why? Because you all seem to be confusing immigration with the refugee issue. The refugee crisis IS the trojan horse. Tell me again how immigration is the trojan horse? You can't.,L
Fine.  The refugee crisis is the Trojan Horse.  And within it are jihadis who want to overthrow and destroy society.  Perfect analogy. I agree.,L
"Are you sure? You seem to be confused between which is which, you seem to view them all as one. Showing your true colours.",L
If you bring in immigrants who are hostile to your culture then you’re going to have to change your culture to accommodate them.,C
Eh... most people with remotely dissenting opinions from the Left know that free speech isn't tolerated on Reddit and have to basically speak in parables to enter the discussion at all without being banned from most subreddits. It is what it is.,C
"Just pull out a new reddit persona. If your words are actually important then they will never be able to silence you. If you're worried about your precious karma and you're attached to your current internet alias, maybe you have different priorities than speaking your mind.",L
"If you keep telling people that wanting a safe homeland is Nazism, people are going to think Nazis weren’t so bad.",C
"If you keep carrying water for fascistic totalitarians, you'll see exactly how bad the Nazis were.",C
"BTW, fascistic totalitarianism wasn't just a Nazi thing. Poland played the same game and annexed part of Czechoslovakia. It was this annexation by Poland that allowed the Nazis to use false flag operations against Poland as an excuse to invade Poland.",C
"In his postwar memoirs, Winston Churchill, a staunch opponent of appeasement, lumped Poland and Hungary, both of which, subsequent to the Munich Agreement, annexed parts of Czechoslovakia containing Polish and Hungarian nationals, with Germany as ""vultures upon the carcass of Czechoslovakia.",C
"Huh. Poland and Hungary. What a coincidence. Why those are the same two countries referenced in the original comment I replied to. It's as though the commenter, who hinted that the current totalitarian leadership in those two countries were behaving like proper little fascists, was ignorant of their actions against Czechoslovakia. I find that hard to believe, don't you?",L

These both seem like factual statements that are either true or false... did they?,L
"They did, but not entirely in deceiving ways. For example, the corners are rounded, meaning you're losing some pixels. I don't think this is a big problem. The lawsuit also says that because no content takes up the bottom or top of the screen from an app, the device actually isn't ""all screen"". The notch is also not included, which I think is a slightly larger problem. The biggest issue is that the pixels on the new iPhones don't actually have a red, green, and blue subpixel, meaning that they aren't legally standard pixels. This is where they real money is in this lawsuit. Also, the advertising showed images where the notch was obscured, meaning that some people might have been surprised with the notch.",L

That’s the industry standard for OLED displays. I don’t think any major manufacturers sells an OLED display that isn’t pentile.,L
"Samsung had 2 RGB panel OLEDs (S2 and first Note). They never used it again, probably for costs",C
The first Note was definitely Pentile.,L
The first and the third. But not the second.,L
"I think it has more to do with burn-in and screen brightness retention over time. By adding a white pixel, you don't have to run the other 3 together to make white.",C
I don’t think any major manufacturers sells an OLED display that isn’t pentile.,L
"Super AMOLED Plus was a thing for a short while. IRC, Galaxy Tab S 10.5 also doesn't have PenTile.",L
"But yeah, it's not that common (since for high ppi displays PenTile is almost unnoticeable).",L
Is there an actual legal definition of a pixel? I know there's industry standards but not aware if there are ones dictated by law.,L
"Considering Samsung, the manufacturer of the OLEDs, has been selling OLED phones for years using similar claims, I don’t think so.",L
"Also, tying in law a requirement that pixels must follow a precise definition will restrict innovation from making fewer sub pixels do more (a key theme in our future of “less does more”)",L
"Can I ask about this? I just got a Samsung Galaxy s5 and its described as ""still one of the best phone cameras in the game"" and apparently the pixels are so small they're invisible, but if I take any close photo, it's grainy. It's not the auto focus, I get that as sharp as possible, but the front camera (which is supposed to be around 1920 x 1600 or something like that) is grainy! Only far away pictures look good.",C
"There's a lot to unpack in that question. There's actually 3 things going on there: screen pixel count, photo pixel count, and photo processing. The camera takes a picture bigger (pixel count) than the screen, so it has to be shrunk down to display, which can produce some ""graininess"". Additionally, the picture the camera takes undergoes a lot of image processing between the raw sensor data and what you see on your screen. Certain conditions when you took the picture could also cause the perceived loss of quality.",L
All of that has nothing to do with the screen pixels directly.,L
Not only that but most camera sensors found in phones suck. They are extremely small and have an extremely high pixel count thanks to the stupid megapixel war. This means that there are millions of extremely tiny pixels on an extremely tiny sensor fighting for light. This increases noise while decreasing image quality.Having a camera handy is a good thing but we should realize that it's just an add on to make casual pictures to share online or print in small format.,C
"The camera takes a picture bigger (pixel count) than the screen, so it has to be shrunk down to display, which can produce some ""graininess"".",L
What? No it doesn't. Downscaling an image will not add grain. In fact it will typically hide defects. What are you talking about?,L
"That's an ISO problem, not resolution. It's basically a function of how CCD imaging works.",L
"I believe most mobile phones, including the S5, actually use CMOS sensors instead of CCDs. Could still be an ISO problem though",C
"I just got a Samsung Galaxy s5 and its described as ""still one of the best phone cameras in the game""",C
Who described it this way? it's a nearly 5 year old phone.,L
"If you're using zoom, that could also be the culprit.",C
Add more light,L
The grain is due to insufficient light. The less light there is the more sensitive the sensor has to be and as a consequence the noise to signal ratio is worse. That grain you see is noise. Some of the newer phones have better low-light performance.,L
I didn’t think it was that great of a camera when it was released four years ago.,L
"Either way, it will have trouble taking photos of things in macro (close-up) and in low light. The front camera is not as capable as the rear camera, and smaller pixels do not make a better camera.",C
"Hey man, sorry youre getting downvoted for asking an honest question. I did my part.",C
"I don’t believe there is a legal definition of the pixel. Most low-end 4K TVs have rgb and pure white ‘pixels’, so there isn’t truly 3840 x 2160 sets of RGB pixels, rather 3840 x 2160 of true RGB mixed with white pixels to give the illusion of 4K",L
"RGBW TVs are rare. Most UHD TVs are 3840x2160 RGB. 4K and UHD are terms used interchangeably, for better or for worse.",L
"All OLED TVs on the market use RGBW pixel structures... But notably, they have four subpixels per pixel. That's different than the LCD RGBW televisions that were replacing full RGB pixels with a single W subpixel.",C
"Yeah, LG is really bad for this on their lower end 4K TVs. Look decent untill you display text on them...",C
Whoa whoa can you clarify this?,L
Thinking of buying family a 4K for Christmas how do you go about assessing them (specs wise) or is it pretty obvious when you see them in a store?,C
"Yeah, so LG did exactly this with some of their lower end models. Look up in rtings",C
They made the pixel structure RGBW effectively only have 3/4 4K,L
"The problem is the background with the planet that hid the notch. That's the main claim, it's just that the source is not very well written. You can find the full story on other news sites. There are people that actually bought it and didn't see the notch",L
"There's a definition of a pixel, here samsung gives some information and sources:",C
https://news.samsung.com/global/what-is-rgbw-tv,C
I thought it was funny how their little paint swirl picture they’re sticking all over the newer iPhone boxes conveniently ends just before the notch.,C
"Yeah, that was really naughty. I noticed that as soon as the XS and XS Max promo images went up.",C
"Yep, I noticed that too. That's going to be the biggest point in the court case. All the other points seem to be trying it on with a reach.",L
That's going to be the biggest point in the court case.,L
Probably not - The launch image for the X included background imagery which prominently showed the notch. The new XS bubble images for the XS/XS+ would only be deceiving if:,L
"The bubble images were actually cut off by the notch, i.e. that some photoshopping had to happen to display them this way. This isn't the case, the new bubble images display exactly like this on the phone. (Note these same images also show the earpiece, albeit faintly.)",L
"Apple only used these images to market the device, i.e. that consumers could be deceived into believing there was no notch. As far as I know these are actually the only images where the notch is hard to notice, the rest are plainly evident. There is no way that someone could go through with a purchase without noticing the notch - and trying to claim damages here would be tricky since apple have a no questions asked 2 week return period.",L
"The notch was not expected. It is expected, the previous model had it, the entire industry has parroted the notch design and apple haven't come out and said there is no notch. There is no reason to ensure that every photo overtly shows the notch. It would be like ensuring that every photo showed the absence of the 3.5mm audio jack.",L
"I agree with you, and I think it's all going to get thrown out. I was saying that's their strongest point, and you just explained and proved how weak it is.",C
"For example, iPhone X's screen size is supposed to be 5.8 inches, but the plaintiffs measured that it's ""only about 5.6875 inches.""",L
Some people just can’t read. So that part is easily defendable. This notification has been there for the iPhone X as well since it’s reveal.,L
I would take that to mean you are getting 5.8” instead of 5.85” because of rounded corner loss,C
I feel like me and you are the only people who are logical here. I agree with you 100%.,L
"Was that statement there from when they started selling the phones? Or was it added later, when people started complaining?",C
"If the latter, then people who bought the phone before the statement was added would still have a strong claim.",L
"It’s been there from the very beginning. Since September 2017, when the iPhone X was announced. I find it dodgy how this lawsuit only appeared now. One year after Apple has released their first all-screen device. That’s why I just cannot take this seriously.",L
"There are hundreds if not thousands of products that could earn their manufacturers a legitimate and well deserved lawsuit, Apple being one of them, no doubts, but this particular one shouldn’t be taken as anything other than what it is: a joke.",C
"It's possibly defendable but it won't necessarily be easy. I don't think Apple would get away with it, for example, if they said the screen was 10"" and then clarified that they were talking about a hypothetical measurement where the screen was about twice as big as it is in reality. This might fly with a good defense since it's closer - but they've still come up with a measurement that's only for a hypothetical display that isn't quite what we have. I don't think they were being malicious, but maybe didn't give enough thought to how to portray screen size to the consumer now that we don't have rectangular displays anymore.",L
"Except the whole point of the diagonal is to give a rough idea of overall screen size, which is largely unchanged with the rounded corners.",L
"So if they used the ""technically correct"" value, it would actually be more misleading to consumers.",L
"As someone who hates big screens, finding out the screen was even bigger than advertised would piss me off pretty bad.",L
"I don’t disagree, but I think there are a lot of people who will look at the same information and disagree.",C
"Sounds like a pretty shitty, money-grubbing lawsuit.",C
"Nvidia's GTX970 graphics card technically had the 4GB of RAM it advertised, but only 3.5GB was useable without causing huge framerate drops because bandwidth to the last 500MB of memory was extremely limited. They got hit with a successful class-action suit and purchasers of the card got about 10% of its retail cost back. Seems like a similar case if the screen area advertised technically exists, but isn't visible due to being obscured by other components on the device.",L
"I had two of them, got a check for both.  $60 bucks minus the lawyer’s cut.",C
You got a check for 12 cents?,C
Remind me of this guy who was a millionaire and he died without signing his will. Almost all of his money ended up being used by lawyers over the years and 100 or so years down the line all of his money left when he died had gone to the lawyers so they basically just packed it up and moved on.,C
I think you're referring to the case of Jennens vs Jennens. He was organising his will but he forgot his glasses so he took the will home to sign but he died before he did.,C
"He was described as the ""richest commoner in England"" when he died unmarried and intestate with a fortune estimated at £2 million,[1][2] worth in excess of £230 million at 2015 rates,[3] which became the subject of legal wrangles (Jennens vs Jennens) in the Court of Chancery for well over a century until the entire estate had been swallowed by lawyers' fees.",L
"Yeah that was the one, definitely the guy who forgot his glasses.",L
I'd say the difference here is obvious. A purchaser can plainly see that a notch and curved corners exist.,L
"Apple's marketing materials also draw attention whenever they refer to the screen size measurement, the wording specifically is:",C
"The display has rounded corners that follow a beautiful curved design, and these corners are within a standard rectangle. When measured as a standard rectangular shape, the screen is 5.85 inches (iPhone XS) and 6.46 inches (iPhone XS Max) diagonally. Actual viewable area is less.",L
"Also noteworthy is that apple markets these sizes as 6.5"" for the 6.46"" display and 5.8 for the 5.85"" display. One could come up with all sorts of theories for why it is rounded this way, but in reality it's very hard to claim one is being deceived about numbers, rounded corners or the notch because merely looking at the device allows the consumer to gain an understanding of the product regardless of any minutiae in interpreting its description.",L
So exactly as CRTs were sold before LCDs and true corner-to-corner measurements became the standard.,L
"The fact that they publish ""viewable area is less"", and was the de-facto standard for screen measurement a generation ago makes it difficult for me to see how this suit could be taken seriously.",L
"The screen doesn’t exist at al in the corners or the notch. It’s physically cut out. Now there is absolutely information rendered for those areas, but it’s physically impossible for the phones to display them as there isn’t anything there to display it with.",L
"it may be, but it suits the company don't you think?",C
"Why? If it's such a non-issue, why didn't Apple just say the real size of the screen? 5.6 does not equal 5.8, so why bother to make shit up? It's not like it would have cost them any sales.",C
"They should be stopped in their tracks for lying. If they don't get stopped in the first instance, they will keep doing it. Fuck them. Why can't they tell their customers the truth and only the truth?",C
It's been clarified as 5.8 but actual viewing area is smaller due to rounded corners since launch.,C
Here's a link to an archived page detailing the iPhone X specs from Sep 13 2017.,C
"The iPhone X display has rounded corners that follow a beautiful curved design, and these corners are within a standard rectangle. When measured as a standard rectangular shape, the screen is 5.85 inches diagonally (actual viewable area is less)",L
"Not only that, but advertising a screen size of 5.6"" would also be misleading - perhaps even more misleading.  That measurement, corner to corner from the rounded bezels, would misstate the height and width of the screen at every point outside the bezel.  It would also suggest a higher pixel density.  In practical use, the phone has a 5.8 inch display.",L
Not that it matters because Apple is more than clear in their language - and literally every single marketing image which clearly shows the device has rounded corners.,L
"I didn't see anything about a 5.6 vs 5.8 figure, just that the button on the phone makes for ""technically"" not all screen. If they were outright lying, then whatever--sue away.",L
"I'm probably being brash with my statement, anyway. It just doesn't feel like the kind of lawsuit one person would levy against someone they actually knew--a heartless artifact of a legal system run amok with impersonal entities gerrymandering whatever legal precedent they can.",L
meaning that they aren't legally standard pixels,C
"There is no such thing as ""legal standard pixels""",L
"This is all just fucking stupid. No one was surprised, no one bought a $1,000 phone after seeing literally one image, closed their eyes and hit the buy button. You'd have to be willfully ignorant to not know there's a notch. And if they somehow were surprised, they could return it.",L
"I dont think that is really point. Im sure you are correct but it is also important to hold companies accountable. If they can get away with small things they will keep doing so until those small things become big things. Theres a lot of lawsuits I think should be thrown out immediately but this one feels like there could be some overall benefit. Apple seems to be on a new path of provide less, charge more and I dont want to see that continue. So hopefully things like this can send a message that if you are going to act like your tech is the best, it better really be the best and be up to the standards you describe.",L
Why did that hide it then? It was pretty obvious to me that Apple was being clever with the screen images in their ads.,L
"As has most advertising been ""clever"" with how they show their products ""good side"" for 100+ years",C
"I think it's as simple as Apple wanting the backgrounds for the OLED displays to have more black in them because it looks nice.  They didn't want the curve of the paint thing to intersect with the notch because it would create  a poor aesthetic with an asymmetry where the notch exists.  For the XR, they chose to make the backgrounds more colorful and the notch is clearly visible in all of them, but they also maintain the symmetry of the notch by not having any lines or points of contrast intersecting it.  Seems more likely they are just playing to the strengths of the different displays and how they show in person than trying to hide anything.  If they were hiding it, why is there no effort to do so with the XR or in any other marketing material?",L
"Call me cynical but I think they chose to consistently show the notch with the XR because it is the lowest-tier of the new phones. From looking at the ads, I see a notchless high- and mid-tier offering and a low-tier offering with a notch. If anything, it furthers my belief that it was intentional, and in recognition that the notch was a potential sore spot for sales.",C
I bet a large percent of customers bought it sight unseen simply because it's the latest model.,L
"I don't think that's true.  A lot of people still buy their phones in the store, where they see the phone before they buy it.  The people who buy their phones online usually do some research.",L
I think it's more likely that people bought the iPhone without looking at the pixel count than they bought it without knowing there was a notch.,L
How many buying an iphone XS even know what a pixel count is?,L
"Well then they don't have a right to complain. If I go to a bar and say ""surprise me"" when I order, I don't get to complain when it's not what I wanted. You have all of human knowledge at your fingertips, willful ignorance is not an excuse.",L
but you do if X alcohol is normal and they charge normal but water it down without telling you but still charge you for full strength.,C
apple was intentionally deceptive. that is not ok. even if it should be obviously deceptive its not ok.,C
apple was intentionally deceptive,C
How so? On every product page they explain that due to the rounded corners the screen will not be as large at it would be if it was square.,C
"While apple does have a disclaimer somewhere on their site, I personally found their screen measurement to be misleading and I was not surprised at all to see this headline.",C
"Tons of websites have been repeating Apple's 5.8"" screen number when the phone screen really is not that large because of the notch.",L
"IMO the only reason they are sticking with the 5.8"" diagonal measurement is because it makes their screen seem larger than the Note line from Samsung. In actuality the note phones have a larger screen area.",L
Edit:,L
The stuff about pixels is bull though. Aren't all Samsung displays pentile? Apple is just sticking with the standard way of reporting resolution,C
Every screen size is measured diagonally.,L
From apple's website.,C
They measure it diagonally because thats how everyone measures it.,L
Couldn’t they fight this with “puffery”?,L
It's a problem if they advertise a certain number of pixels and you don't actually have those numbers in the phone,L
I noticed that about the marketing materials. The XS Maxx had a knot here but the others had a clever picture of Saturn that had a black background that made it look like the knot had was not there. I thought it was deceiving BS.,C
"Also, the advertising showed images where the notch was obscured",L
Yeah the planet background on all of the X phones was misleading as hell.,L
Every single image of the X had that black space background to hide the notch it's a bunch of bullshit.,C
Do YOU want to  be the one who has to count all those pixels!?,C
"I'm off by 1, better count it again to be sure..",L
Do I get paid?,C
Yes but only as much as the children who assemble the phones.,C
Can I make my children do it?,C
That out of the box thinking right here. Someone hire this guy.,C
we hired his kids,C
cheaper,L
Now they’re gonna hire you!,C
Pay them in fortnite playtime.,C
Apple let election committees from Florida count the pixels.,L
Eh... both of these are actually kind of up for interpretation.,L
"Screen size is typically measured across the diagonal of the screen. It's a measure of length, not area, so it doesn't account for things like notches or rounded corners. Screen size has never been consistent with screen area as historically many different aspect ratios have been used that can all have the same diagonal size but different areas.",L
"For pixels, it depends whether calling something a pixel legally means it has to have 3 RGB subpixels. I don't think it does. Most AMOLED displays have used a PenTile layout that shares subpixels between pixels. In my experience at 1440p resolutions or above on phone-size screens the results are nearly indistinguishable from an RGB display. I can instantly tell if a 1080p phone screen is PenTile or not though. The iPhone resolution is close to 1440p so I'm going to guess this lawsuit will go nowhere, especially because Samsung has been using PenTile displays in its phones from the original Galaxy S.",L
"It might not be pixels that gets them. I think they'll get called out for resolution/dpi, per primary.",L
Which would open up for people to sue basically every manufacturer who uses oled displays in their phones.,L
Sure they are. But they get to go to court and argue over the definition of a pixel. If they don’t have the judge throw out the lawsuit first. And there’s miles of red tape before they could actually get anyone to sit down and answer a question like that.,L
"Likely no. Their marketing materials even reference it is for a squared off screen. It is how I would state it too, as it is the only logical way. This is simply someone trying get a free buck from a big company.",L
Did they count all of them,L
I'm wondering if we'll start seeing screen sizes listed as area instead of diagonal measurements to account for rounded corners.,L
"I'd prefer width and height but, yes, I think it needs changing.",C
Then someone would sue apple cuz their corners are rounded and that height and width aren't the same across the entire phone.,L
I have a fold away table with rounded corners. Is that also unacceptable?,C
I mean how is that measured? And mine was supposed to be sarcasm because unless you do an average you can't really get an exact measurement on something that isn't a perfect box (unless you just do area).,C
what if you have a notch on the side though?,C
"No that’s dumb.  If you want a full resolution wallpaper to show off your high DPI display, you need to know the dimensions, regardless of the fact that the corners and notch get cropped out",L
"The suit alleges that Apple lied about the screen sizes by counting non-screen areas like the notch and corners. So the new line of iPhones aren't ""all screen"" as marketed, according to the 55-page complaint. For example, iPhone X's screen size is supposed to be 5.8 inches, but the plaintiffs measured that it's ""only about 5.6875 inches.""",L
Nobody who has ever had a real problem in their life would sue over something like this.,L
"I’m with you - it sounds ridiculous. But on the other hand, how far off do the measurements have to be before you give a shit and call it false advertising? Half an inch? A whole inch? Who defines it?",L
"Yeah I'm with you, I'd rather err on the side of caution, it's not like their suing some mom and pop shop and are aiming to shut them down. Even if this lawsuit wins it'll only be a few weeks before they make back that money they lost. I'm not going to buy into a sob story for a billion dollar corporation.",C
A few weeks before they make it back? Lol,C
it'll only be a few weeks before they make back that money they lost.,L
More like a day.,C
billion dollar corporation,C
 Trillion dollar company.,C
Especially when your talking about a device as expensive as these are nowadays.,L
"The measurements aren't ""off,"" there just do not exist easily interpretable summary statistics for a screen of a non rectangular shape. How would you describe the shape of that screen in a number? The use of the closest approximation to the traditional screen size measurement used literally everywhere else makes sense to me. And there's a disclaimer.",L
"The number of people in reddit defending this lawsuit is hilarious. Some people are complaining that Apple's webpage tried to ""hide"" the notch, which is absolutely risible, and I'm fairly certain anyone who's making this claim can see how bullshit it is just by thinking about it.",C
Why the fuck do you people have such a massive erection for hating on Apple? It's seriously pathetic.,L
I can't even understand why anyone would give a shit?  Do you sit there in a pissing contest arguing over how many pixels your phone has over another and get paid for it?,L
Your paying for a status symbol (edit couldn't think of the word a min ago).,C
People find any reason to sue for “easy” money. If a class action comes out of this the lawyers will get a shit ton of money if they win and the plaintiffs will get like a $3 iTunes gift card.,C
Where can I get a $3 iTunes gift card? Christmas is coming up.,L
I believe you can create digital iTunes gift cards with a specific amount.,C
I believe that you can sue Apple citing that they lied about their pixel counts to get that gift card.,C
This is 2018. We’ll sue anyone for anything if we can make a profit from it.,C
*this is america,C
Don't catch you slippin' up,L
"I think the lawyers missed their calling, 5.6875 inches is 14.44625cm. They have managed to measure down to the micron level, that’s some serious accuracy.",L
"Seeing as the discrepancy here is much less than say cited storage on digital devices, this does not stand a chance in hell.. Just another non-grievance by some inconsequential litigious asshole.",L
"I mean, that's different though. There's not actually a discrepancy in storage, it's just the difference between base 10 and base 2 or how much space the preloaded software takes up.",L
Hard drives have used base 10 for years and justify it using the SI system of units.,L
"If you want base 2, you look for the Gebi-, Mebi-, Kibi- bytes units. They sound stupid but they’re unambiguously base 2.",C
Except for RAM... they follow base 2 and call it the same thing the storage vendors on base 10.  So who’s the one who’s lying...?,L
"Neither. If you'd like a deeper discussion of the base-2 (memory, cpu cache size), base-10 (network, magnetic hard drives, CPU frequency), I would suggest this article by Bruce Dawson.",L
"He cites the great capacity non-conspiracy as a source, which does neatly call out the following in the first couple of paragraphs:",L
"For any readers who don't know, RAM is sold in base-2 units because RAM, at least originally, had to connect to an address bus that directly activates the memory cells that are going to be read. This required some kind of segmentation by address-lines, hence a requirement that any unit of RAM be a power of 2 size.",L
"In the 1960s, computer designers knew using K/k was a bad idea since it already meant 1000(or Kelvin), but every other symbol idea seemed worse, and so K came into use for 1024 bytes of RAM, as it was convenient and the extra 24 bytes were no big deal, particularly when some computers were lucky to have 4K. This corruption of meaning then fanned out, growing larger as the power of 2 diverges from base-10.",L
"After everybody was 'educated' about what a kilobyte of RAM was(without explaining why), certain people, particularly OS and app programmers, proceded to use the RAM definition everywhere else.",L
"But there is no evidence it was being used by storage vendors, and especially not in network capacities.(kilobit,megabit,gigabit per second are all base-10, as well as frequencies Mhz/Ghz)",C
"Storage has typically been addressed through LBA (block numbers) or a physical address (cluster/head/sector) method, which does not imply a base-2 limitation. The only concession was to eventually use a 512-byte sector as the standard. Before that, sector sizes could vary greatly without a base-2 connection.",L
Thanks for sharing,L
And yet the bayer pattern in CMOS sensors has always been accepted as non-relevant for the pixel count.  It is the same type of non-grievance and litigious nonsense like this should be fined heavily.,L
"Not really. If the device is advertised as having N GBs of memory, but only 80% at beast are accessible to the user, then it's a false/sleazy advertising. If the user has the ability to remove all the crapware/change the OS (this is the case for PCs), then it's not.",L
"I agree that it's a minor issue but the claimants are factually correct. The screen is not the size which was advertised, anyone with a tape measure can see this",L
"Many countries, such as Denmark, don’t have Apple stores. We do have premium resellers, though.",L
That's great if you live somewhere that has an Apple Store nearby.,L
"It's a couple of hours for me, so if I wanted to buy an Apple product I would very likely read reviews and tests online, and then order it through Apple's online store.",C
There are also entire countries where Apple sells devices but doesn't have physical stores.,L
"You don’t have any sort of electronics store? Verizon, att, tmobile, best buy, costco, or any other store that has displays?",L
I think the one about the screen size being a lie is a reasonable complaint. If you're going to give diagonal measurements then you don't get to extrapolate the side edges to the point past where the rounded corners are. That's just bs.  Here's the text about it from the article.,L
"iPhone X's screen size is supposed to be 5.8 inches, but the plaintiffs measured that it's ""only about 5.6875 inches.""",L
"On the iPhones tech specs page, they actually specify that number comes from the rectangle and not the corners on there.",L
If you're going to give diagonal measurements then you don't get to extrapolate the side edges to the point past where the rounded corners are.,L
"I can see the argument. No one actually cares about the diagonal distance - they use it as a proxy to get a rough impression of the width and height. I mean, if you get a 60"" TV, you don't expect it to be sixty inches long and one inch high. No, you kind of do some math in your head and imagine something about 52""x29"".",L
"With that in mind, Apple gave the number that correctly represents the dimensions of the screen.",L
If you claim something is 5.8 inches but there is literally no dimension where the thing measures 5.8 inches then I just can't see that as anything but a lie.,C
You could probably measure from the front bottom left corner to the back top right corner.,C
Yeah that part confuses me. The lawsuit is saying they should measure from the rounded edge but then you cut off the sides of the screen and it's actually smaller. For me knowing the screen size as apple stated it gives me a better understanding of the actual phone body size.,L
"True, but which is a greater lie?",L
"5.8"" minus corners is closer to the real number of pixles then 5.6875""",L
By several orders of magnitude.,L
"This is an artifact of language advancing slower then the technology. We have described images in many ways. Lines of resolution, X by Y, mega pixles",C
Maybe we have come to the point where a screen should be described by it's total number of pixles /  elements.,L
Haha. This suit is going to be thrown out.,L
"The iPhone XS display has rounded corners. When measured as a rectangle, the screen is 5.85 inches diagonally. Actual viewable area is less. -- iPhone Xs Tech Specs",L
Yeah lmao the tech specs literally says when viewed as a rectangle,L
"It looks in the article like the width is the same and the height is shorter. But did apple really lie? The screen on the X wraps over on itself on the bottom and you can't see the whole thing, is it possible apple said the whole resolution of the panel, not just what was visible? Normally I'm against Apple all the time, but I'm not really sure they lied on this one.",C
"Lawsuits like this annoy me.  Even assuming that someone bought the phone sight unseen, most stores have a return policy of some sort if the phone is not to the person’s liking.  The purchaser can easily judge the screen size and image quality to determine if it is to that person’s liking and worth whatever they paid for it.",L
I wouldn’t be surprised if this is just an attempted cash grab by the law firm and the named plaintiffs.,C
So suing companies for false advertisement bothers you. Get it.,L
It’s obvious that’s what this is. I hope these people get laughed out of the courtroom (if it makes it that far).,L
"The lawsuit is actually frivolous imo. You don’t put out thousands of showrooms where people can try all your phones for free and make it a whole experience, only to be chewed out on the paper specs don’t list exactly what the models show. That’s an honest typo rather than something malicious.",L
"I agree with you re the lawsuit, but I highly doubt it was a typo. These companies don't make many mistakes like that. They almost certainly put down the highest numbers they felt they could justify legally.",L
"The real question is how would you account for the missing pixles in a way that does not confuse the customer, or require re-education.",L
The way we communicate the general quality of a screen assumes the screen is some kind of rectangle. The iphone screen is not a rectagle.,L
"This reminds me of the CRT days, where the size of the tube was listed, rather then the viewing area. I would guess that if there is a leagal precedent for CRT size, that would strongly influance the outcome of this case.",L
Isn't it damages and not intent that matters in civil suits?,L
I wonder what constitutes damages here. I bet apple could pick up video tapes of some customers personally toying with the show models before purchasing one to prove they knew what they were buying.,L
Do those customers represent the average customer? Or are they just a smaller subset. What percentage of iPhone sales are in person vs online? Is it clear that the specs listed include or disclose the bevel? Can a customer be reasonably expected to see the specific show room displays for these before their purchase?,L
All they have to do is prove that in some area people could be misled using false or misleading information of a purchase. This could mean just getting a small percentage of a purchase back instead of it's full value or personal damages however.,L
Similar cases where false advertising did take place just mean having to refund a percentage of the item value.,C
"You're not allowed to advertise something as having 400 horsepower that only has 200 because ""they could go to a showroom and test the actual performance for themselves""",L
"Wait - typo? As in ""typographical error""? As in if you asked Apple to clarify the screen size and resolution of these phones you wouldn't repeatedly and consistently get the same answer?",L
I don't think so. Learn what typo means.,L
Who the fuck cares? Honestly people get so mad over the dumbest things.,L
Lawyers looking for a quick buck,L
"I’m a sick fuck, I like the quick buck.",L
"This is petty, even for a tech lawsuit",C
"The amount of people that don’t know geometry is staggering. And e can’t have a discussion on area, rectangles, and corners without people raising pitch forks against corporations?",C
"So stupid. Any idiot can look at the phone’s screen and see that it’s not a perfect rectangle. Also, the diamond pixel layout on the X is really great. I prefer it to square pixel and definitely pentile screens. By the way, if you hold an iPhone 8 next to an X, you can very clearly see that the X’s screen is more detailed.",L
Lawyer clearly does not understand lcd technology. I also pretty clearly remember reading the lcd specs with a note made that the resolution and screen size is what it would be if there was no notch/rounded corners. I specifically remember reading that when going through the specs page.,L
Wait until they find out about the actual measurements of 2x4 boards!,L
Is this like that lawsuit aganist Subway where the sandwich was not 12 inches and they said 12 inches is a name and not a description?,L
"""footlong""  was the term",L
If I remember correctly the bread was being baked to 11 inches and subway ended up paying fines or some shit based off of that.,C
Samsung shares pixels for years with there pentile arrangement on their amoled screens. That is why they are not as sharp as the lcd competition. I too believe it is fraud claiming it is a 1080 screen while only the green pixels are 1080 and the blue and red are half of it.,C
"Damn I thought they had gotten rid of Pentile. It was rubbish on 720p screens, but the impact of the compromise has been reduced by higher resolutions.",C
The opposite. They made full RGB oled displays for a few years and then got rid of them. All of Samsung's oled displays (and therefore the entire industry's oled displays) have been pentile for the past ~6 years or so.,L
"Damn, I'm out of date. Iirc the Note went to RGB for Note 2 (which was an amazing display for the time), but I had no idea they had gone back!",L
The 1440p resolutions of the newer phones seem to be enough to obscure it.,L
"Fucking FUCK that site. No, you are not having my location and you should be fucking shot for having autoplaying videos with the fucking volume turned to the max.",L
"I wonder how this lawsuit will set the precedent for other edge-to-edge displays. Apple isn't unique in this category and there are other phones out there that advertise a certain aspect ratio, resolution, and screen size but given the fact that they push the screen to the edges, the tradition definitions for those categories don't really apply anymore since they were designed for exactly rectangular screens.",L
Up the refresh rate and reduce the number of pixels to 1.,L
Damn - somebody beat me to it - I am still counting.,L
Haven't monitor and television manufacturers been rounding up by a half inch for decades in the us?,C

An off-duty Palm Beach County sheriff's deputy will not face charges...,C
He wasn't even doing on duty.,L
Yeah that was the info I needed. Like he is showing bad judgement either way but not being on duty AND not responding to an emergency means this fucker should be treated like anyone else. You should not get special privileges due to your employment or employer.,C
..but he’s a cop. That’s not how it works because there’re better then us.,L
"This will never change unless the authoritarian worship stops. Seeing as how it's tied to the mandated troop worship in a way, and the majority of both sides do want law and order, justice etc, ( just differing visions of what that means ), police accountability is still just a dream.",L
Police accountability is a key part of law and order and justice.,C
"Sure, but not in our system, at least not anymore.",C
"Our justice system is run on fear and money. There's no place for holding enforcers accountable, and that means lost revenue as well.",L
"No, our judgment system is run on money and power. We have no justice system in America.",L
It's our injustice system,C
"Your wealth, not your innocence, is the main determination for your outcome in the judicial system.",C
"But not an important one, according to voters who refuse to vote out prosecutors who go easy on bad cops.",L
"One of the primary points of being a ""country of laws"" is that the same law applies to everyone, including government officials.  It pisses me off to no end to think that people claim to be for ""law and order"", when they are actually the exact opposite.  You cannot be for ""law and order"" if you view anyone as deserving of special treatment under the law.",L
"They should be,at least. If we follow that logic,he should be punished even more harshly",C
"Frankly, It's the ""responding to an emergency"" that counts.  Not being on duty.",L
"""These laws apply to all of you, but not to us.""",C

Yo them donuts won't eat themselves!,L
"Only semi-related, but remember a few years back when officers were protesting because they felt they had the right to fix tickets issued to themselves and family/friends instead of paying them like the rest of us plebs?",L
It's like being an officer means you automatically view yourself as separate from and not beholden to the rules you were hired to enforce.,L
"Cops in Massachusetts can purchase whatever firearms they want regardless of laws, yet I go through just as much of  background check process as they do and cannot.",C
Two classes of citizens in the country.,L
"Well, law enforcement aren’t beholden to the same rules as the rest of us. Eg police can park pretty much wherever they want. Sometimes it’s a legit emergency parking situation. Most of the time it’s not. But who’s going to ticket them?",L
Wasn't just police officers. It was family and friends who are not police officers that they felt they had the right to fix tickets for. Why does being related to or knowing an officer give you a free pass when it comes to tickets?,L
"power, corruption, entitlement",L
I've actually seen one Chase a ice cream truck with siren on to get ice cream,L
My girlfriends cousin is a cop and has Chron's disease. Has literally confessed to lighting up the sirens and blowing through intersections just so she could go home and take a shit.,L

I work by one of the B&T entrances in the city... seeing the number of cars with tinted windows at shift change that go through the 'emergency' entrance & skip the wait is maddening.,L
I live in NYC as well. I see them roll passed red lights/stop signs without their lights or sirens on almost daily.,C
"I'd just like to point out that the sign had had been blocked by vegetation, as said in the article. Though one would think that someone who was a deputy might be familiar enough with the area to know about the stop sign.",C
Prosecutors said Thursday the stop sign was blocked by a low-hanging tree and drivers traveling at or above the speed limit would not have seen it. ,C

And this is why the image of law enforcement continues to erode.,L
"If you’re a cop, you should be even more pissed off than the rest of us. If you aren’t, you’re part of the problem.",L
I'm a cop and I'm pissed at both the deputy and the prosecutor.,C
"The deputy should have never been going that fast (especially while  off duty and not responding to an emergency), and the prosecutor should have never dismissed charges. I think that any accusations against cops should automatically result in a special prosecutor being appointed. Cops and prosecutors work so closely together, so having a local prosecutor is a conflict of interest.",C
"It can be done right: Texas has the Texas Rangers, a state agency that investigates officer misconduct (along with other serious crimes). When the Dallas cop shot the guy in the wrong apartment a few months back, the Rangers took over the investigation, and they don't piss around.",L
Here in St. Louis our prosecutors are voting on joining the police union....it's insane that is allowed,C
Yeah... I'd happily say the prosecutors should have a union... just not the same one as the police.,L
I'd say make a lawyer's union... let the prosecutors and the defenders join.,L
I'd say make a lawyer's union... let the prosecutors and the defenders join.,L

Literally every single person I know from St. Louis drives like a fucking asshiole maniac.,L
In MA we have the Staties... but they’re a bit busy with the FBI investing them for Overtime fraud.,C
"If overtime fraud is the only thing they're guilty of (which is unlikely), I wouldn't really mind. Sure, it's still theft from the taxpayers, but it's still better than the systemic corruption in many local departments.",L
"If someone tattled on them for overtime fraud, the first place I’d look for corruption is at the person who reported that.",C
Nobody ratted. They finally caught up to everyone when someone appealed the ticket and the trooper that showed up wasnt the trooper that wrote the ticket. That was the first domino.,L
"Wait, so people were working but lying about who was doing the work so someone could get OT instead?  Like what, the person getting OT would keep the increase in pay and the other officer would get normal pay without taxes or something?",L
"So... my understanding is that they were dating tickets for ""future shifts""... ghost shifts... then putting in for the OT. Im not sure how it got crossed up but when it got sent over to court they realized that the trooper that had written it wasnt the one who appeared and the driver confirmed that and it sort of unraveled a scheme to use the MSPs complex budget (Troop F was funded by MassPort, E was funded by the DoT, the rest by the state) to essentially work ghost shifts. Super complicated but they are going thru years of payroll to find these guys.",L
And once they find them. Nothing will happen.,C
"I dunno man, it's one thing to steal from or hurt regular people, it's quite another to steal from the government",L
"Lmao... a few have been ordered to pay back what they took, i think one or two got time, the rest are all pending. Believe its around 30 total so far.",L
"I used to drive for a black car service that primarily drove people to Logan Airport. The Staties mostly just sit in their cars at every terminal doing nothing for hours and getting overtime. Sometimes they'd try and direct traffic when it got really congested, but most of the time they'd sit there even if the terminals were a mess.",C
And getting $100k+/year for their trouble.,C
Do you like coming to work everyday dressed like you're goin' to invade Poland?,C
As an Arizonan who set up shop in MA for a year back in college...I’m not a fan of the Staties. Never in my life have I been so shook coming around a corner at 65mph to see what looks like a cop standing outside his car pointing a gun at me as I fly by.,L
If you're under 75 they don't usually bug you too much on the Pike.  I have seen some though that will stand outside vehicles with radar guns and pull people over.  Its gotta be nice being a cop in MA.,L
In my opinion MA has some of the best drivers in the country. They drive fast and are always on the offense. Roundabouts are cutthroat and I loved it.,L
"Highly skilled, but very selfish and aggressive.",C
Agreed but I’ll take that over a sea of snowbirds who’s reaction times are half what they need be. The roads are deadly out here because of it.,L
"I don't understand the prosecutor's reasoning here. ""The stop sign was partially obscured and traveling that fast he couldn't have seen it"".",L
"Like... what? ""Well if you're driving recklessly, you can't possibly have known to follow the traffic rules, so it's really just not his fault"".",C
What the actual fuck?,L
"Translation: ""As a prosecutor I rely heavily on the police to make my cases. Their union has informed me that if I prosecute this officer for his obvious crimes, I'm going to run into a lot of problems prosecuting my cases.""",C
The deputy should have never been going that fast (especially while off duty and not responding to an emergency),L
"What the actual fuck, ""off-duty"" AND ""not responding""",L
"Seriously, there is no excuse.  Just none.  End of conversation.",C
"It would be different if he was on duty in a marked car responding to a serious crash/shooting/(insert other tragedy here). We get training in emergency driving at the academy. It's a cost-benefit situation. Going lights-and-sirens is more dangerous, but there are times where it should be done.",C
And there are times when it's done because someone's late. I've seen local police turn off lights and sirens after crossing a live intersection.,L
"It could just be a ""code 2"" response. We tend to use it for things like physical domestic disputes with no weapons involved. Someone's probably going to be on the ground by the time we get there, but there's no shooting or stabbing that has occurred.",L
"Of course, there is still the very real possibility that an officer was misusing his lights and sirens. Most cars keep a log of every time we turn on our lights and sirens, and our sergeant will let us know if something doesn't match up. Not all departments are like this, though.",C
"Of course, there is still the very real possibility that an officer was misusing his lights and sirens.",L
"I've seen the locals where I work light up at an intersection to run the red and immediately pull into a Dunkin' Donuts. I mean, great job there Barney Fife, way to live up to the stereotype, you know? Of course, this is the same department that flash-banged a heroin stash house causing a bunch of officers to have to be treated for exposure to heroin and fentanyl, so...",L
My local department is mostly useless. I gave a detective good video and clear photos of a guy breaking into my car and he literally did nothing with it. Remains unsolved because I'm sure he has hundreds of the same crime to solve.,L
"OK? Not sure what your story there has to do with cops abusing their sirens, but chances are the case went nowhere because a photo means nothing unless you already have a suspect or some way to identify them.",L
Can I ask why lights and sirens makes the situation more dangerous? It seems like it would be the opposite in my head.,C
"I guess I wasn't clear enough. Lights and sirens aren't dangerous in and of themselves, but driving at high speeds and going through intersections is.",C
"Lights and sirens are dangerous because it causes other drivers to behave unpredictably. The law is ""pull to the right and stop"" (at least in my state), but that rarely happens.",C
"On a given shift we have people go left, right, slam on their breaks in front of us, run through red lights, etc... And that's before we even get to running red lights and exceeding the speed limit ourselves.",C
"Some people get nervous, others are idiots, and others are just assholes.",L
It would be different if he was on duty in a marked car responding to a serious crash/shooting/(insert other tragedy here).,L
No it wouldn't. You're still supposed to stop momentarily at signs and lights. Then traffic is supposed to yield to you.,L
"Depends on the state. In Georgia, you're only required to use ""due regard"", which means you can slow down without stopping as long as an intersection is clear. Agencies may add their own policies that place additional restrictions, though.",C
"The point about different policies is fair, but it still doesn't mean a marked and en route vehicle would change the circumstances here. It still wouldn't be excusable for him to blow through at high speed.",C
"What the actual fuck, ""off-duty"" AND ""not responding""",L
That was like the first sentence of the article...,C
Hell even when you respond to an emergency with lights and sirens running you still are required by law to enter into an intersection with due diligence everytime. That means even though you can bypass stop signs and stop lights you still need to slow down and make sure it's safe.,L
"Cops and prosecutors work so closely together, so having a local prosecutor is a conflict of interest.",L
"Not only that, but city prosecutors essentially RELY on cops casework to make their cases and keep their conviction rate high as i understand it.",C
when you are in Texas look behind you... cuz that's where a ranger is gonna be.,L
"Was told to watch The Rookie since I love Nathan Fillion. Of course the episode I watched was super serious where he shot a perp. I thought that episode did the best job I've ever seen of a fictionalized experience to go through all press, personal stress, and IA investigation when committing an otherwise ""crime"" and you really felt the anxiety.",L
"Anyway, not really related to your point shot special prosecutors but it did a great job of encapsulating the behind the scenes stuff at least for this civilian.",C
"Honestly, it should just be hired out to a private firm.  The firm would be paid hourly, so would actually be motivated to bring a case and argue that side, and they don't have the massive conflicts of interest any state-appointed lawyer would.",L
I don't agree with any investigatory agency being paid hourly or per case. It needs to be a flat salary.,L
"Police in the US during the prohibition era were often paid on a ""spoils system."" They got a very low hourly wage, and were expected to find illegal alcohol shipments. When they found illegal alcohol, they got a cut of the seized property (much like civil forfeiture in modern times, which is equally bullshit). Sounds good in theory, but it led to police just breaking into random people's houses looking for bootleg alcohol. It's the same reason why ticket quotas are supposed to be illegal.",L
"An independent legal firm being tasked with assuming the role of prosecutor in cases involving police would not have that problem.  They cannot create cases, and there is a party on the other side providing natural checks and balances.  The problem now is that there is a 'defense' on behalf of the cop, and no prosecution since the prosecutors don't want to try a cop.  You don't put the independent prosecutor on a salary because they'd wind up the same as we have, not bothering to try cases.  Make them want a case to go to trial and be fully investigated for the sake of their paycheck.",C
"FDLE is going to piss around when it's on their side of the thin blue line. You must remember, FL is the 'right to scam' state.",C
I think that any accusations against cops should automatically result in a special prosecutor being appointed.,C
"This is why I am extremely suspicious of anyone who says we need ""small government"". The best way to enact such a department overseeing prosecution of police would be through the Federal DoJ. The problem with doing it at the local level or the state level is the people in power are still too tied to local politics. End of the day, the Governor and District Attorneys of Florida depends on the support of the local police unions. An attorney working for the Federal DOJ, on the other hand, doesnt give a shit what a bunch of cops think about them and can prosecute properly.",L
Did that chick used to date the guy??,L
"I mean, they do have Chuck Norris. That is as serious as it gets",C
You know what? Thank you so much for bringing some comic relief into this thread. I'm tired of dealing with keyboard warriors who shit on me for being a cop. You're alright.,C
It's okay they'll just make a new propaganda show portraying how hard it is to be a cop. How about Arizona Vice? They could use the PR right now.,L
"I live near here is there anywhere I can go protest this absolute fucking horse shit? Listen if you’re a cop and not pissed off about this you’re part of the issue. This PoS deserves the max amount of penalty, literally fuck him.",L
You can vote and help get rid of Rick Bradshaw in 2020.,L
"And yet some people wonder why others view law enforcement as having kind of a black eye. The double standards in this country are ridiculous, any normal citizen does that and their life is over.",L
I don't view them as having a black eye.,L
"I view them having black, empty corrupted souls.",C
Black Souls Matter Too.,L
Criminal police and their unaccountability is a major problem.,C
I'd like to point out that it was the Delray Beach police department who determined his reckless speed and charged him accordingly.,L
https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/fl-ne-wpec-no-charges-deputy-20181214-story.html,L
That article adds a key piece of info to this story. It says the property insurance for the owner of the tree paid out a settlement to both sides. They essentially admitted fault for this ordeal and squashed the case against the officer.,L
"on reason why i hate this world "" Prosecutors said Thursday the stop sign was blocked by a low-hanging tree and drivers traveling at or above the speed limit would not have seen it "" so this would of played different if dude would of hit the cop",C
No way a cop wouldn't give me a ticket for that in Palm Beach. No Fucking way. What a fucking cop out.,L
"Anything over 20 mph is reckless in Virginia, and this dude was doing 53 in a 25!  ...and blew through a stop sign?!",C
"If any normal person did this they would be locked up on multiple violations, this dude gets fuck all.",L
The article doesn’t indicate whether or not he got a ticket. Criminal prosecution is very different than getting a speeding ticket.,C
"“Sorry, officer. It’s hard to read speed limit signs when I’m driving that fast. I’m cool hitting all those people though, right?”",C
"I'm sure that if a 17 year old Black teenager had ran a stop sign at 53 mph and killed an off-duty police officer, the outcome would have been the same.",C
LOL.,C
Wouldn't need to kill the cop. Even sending him into a coma would land him a long term prison sentence.,L
"If by ""long term prison sentence"" you mean shot for resisting arrest, then I agree.",C
"They make it sound as if the officer is the fucking victim. Disgusting, pathetic, impotent prosecutor. I hear WPB is a crooked as fuck town.",C
"It basically invalidates that stop sign until they send a crew to prune the tree - anyone who runs it can just say ""sorry, I was traveling the speed limit and could not see the sign all I saw was a tree."" and any half competent attorney will just point to the prosecutor's own statement here in this case.",C
So what's the law for an intersection that is not signed?  I'm guessing blowing through it at twice the speed limit isn't the rules of the road in that situation...,L
"Which is why city crews are on the scene, fixing the problem as we speak.  So you don't get into a what's good for the cop is good for the public situation.",L
Still sets a precedent. Might work down the road for other signs,L

fuck ric bradshaw by the way,L
Why do regular prosectuors get used for cases involving cops? It makes no fucking sense.,L
Anytime someone who is/was/has close relations to a cop is alleged to commit a crime they should be prosecuted by a special prosecutor.,L
It's not as if cops in America commiting crimes is so rare that it wouldn't make sense to have a special position like that.  If such a thing happened thousands of special prosecutors would be busy every damn day.,C
And cops wonder why the public doesn't trust them. SMH.,C
From the headline I was thinking he was on duty and responding to a call but nope...motherfucker was off duty and still got away with it...ridiculous.,C
Investigators say the Palm Beach County deputy was driving 53 mph (85 kph) in a 25 mph (40 kph) when his pickup ran the stop sign and smashed into a truck carrying Fox. The University of Central Florida aeronautics engineering student was comatose for a month and remains in rehabilitation. Prosecutors said Thursday the stop sign was blocked by a low-hanging tree and drivers traveling at or above the speed limit would not have seen it. D'Avanzo remains on duty. Fox's family declined comment.,C
"Big surprise, prosecutors looking out for cops. If you're in a fucking 25 mph zone you don't need a speed limit sign to tell you what's a safe speed. That also doesn't excuse running the fucking stop sign.  Cops piss me the fuck off. Fuck those cock sucking motherfuckers.",L
The stop sign was blocked from his vision which made it completely ok to drive with twice the speed limit through the intersection. Logic!,C
"Of course he won't face charges, did you know that badge puts him above the law? /s",L
"Unfortunately that ""/s"" is no longer applicable. What you just said is pretty accurate and terrifying. Safest place for evil people to hide in America is either in the CEO's office or behind a badge.",L
Of course he won't - cops never face punishment for anything. That's why they feel free to kill unarmed people and brutalize the public.,L
"I wish I could become a cop and get immunity from prosecution along with a massive load of authority. Unfortunately, those lousy morals of mine keep getting in the way...",C
How long before the thin blue liners come in here to victim blame and defend these POS?,L
"No charges, but he'll get sued and the taxpayers of PBC will foot the bill, as usual",C
"with any luck though there won't be any insurance or employer coverage for an off-duty incident. And he'll face personal liability for this. As a trial attorney my first step would be a motion in limine to exclude evidence that he wasn't criminally charged, which you know his defense will try to introduce.",C
"The area that this happened in, you would have to be inebriated to be going that fast in that area.  This isn't some wide set of lanes where you could just ""accidentally"" plow through a stop sign at 53mph.  This is the same area that people were bitching about stop signs being blocked by trees, like this would have prevented this from happening.",C
"edit:  I just re-read it and it does in fact mention the complaint people had of the ""low hanging tree.""  But I still don't give a fuck.  You do not go through a residential neighborhood at 53 fucking miles an hour.  Blame the stop sign all you want, this guy clearly was being a willfully ignorant piece of crap to be doing what he was doing.  I could understand not paying attention to your speed, maybe going 30 or 35mph.  But 53mph, no.  I do not understand that.  You are actively giving it enough gas to go 53 mph, the speed was intentional.",C
"If you are a police officer, you should be held to a higher standard of behavior.  On duty or off duty, I don't give a fuck.  You need to be held to a higher standard.  If it were any one of us low-lives, we would have been charged with a crime.  The family of that poor girl has to not only deal with what has happened to her, but they have to deal with the public news that he isn't even being charged with anything.",L
"I wonder why he was going through there in the first place?  If he regularly goes through there, he would have known about the stop sign anyway.  I always slow down if i am in a residential area with an intersection, many don't have stop signs, they rely on you slowing down and yielding to whoever was there first.",L
He must at least be civilly liable.,C
I saw people protesting at the courthouse with signs about a cop killing a child. I’m in the legal field and had no clue what was on. It’s very disappointing there wasn’t more coverage and accountability here...,C

"Funny, I don't think that excuse would have worked for a civilian.",L
"Well duh, no one is above the law, except for cops, politicians, CEOs, foreign assassins, judges, wealthy families, etc.",L
I’ll be bringing a copy of this article to jury duty in a few weeks to show how corrupt our justice system is and why I’m no good for jury.,C
Don't do that. Part of our duty as citizens is to hold law enforcement accountable through the jury (that's why they exist). If you listen to the evidence and decide the person is innocent then you can save someone's life.,L
"Even if they did commit the crime but you find it an unjust law you have the power of jury nullification, which is to find them innocent.",C
Don't cede your power to the state because they are corrupt. Take that power and use it to deliver a tiny bit of justice.,L
Thanks. There is something called jury selection and that’s where lawyers and the court can decide to remove certain people from the jury that exhibit certain biases. I’m aware I have certain biases so I’m just saving everyone time. I’m not ceding any power to the state. There’s more than one way to skin a cat.,L
"I am shocked, I tell you, just shocked. Imagine.",C
Prosecutors said Thursday the stop sign was blocked by a low-hanging tree and drivers traveling at or above the speed limit would not have seen it.,C
"The boys family should be getting ready to sue Palm Beach County for not properly maintaining the visibility of their traffic signs. I still blame the cop for speeding, but if the sign truly wasn't visible, that's on the county.",L
Knowing these stories it’ll probably be the only thing they can actually sue for. The cop would probably weasel out of the suit for a minuscule amount.,L
"He was speeding. Sign or no sign, he caused an accident while committing a crime. This should be enough to show culpability. If he had been driving the speed limit he may have had time to swerve or brake.",C
"For as long as law enforcement puts themselves above the law, law enforcement doesn't deserve your trust or support.",C
If it were a civilian the lack of stop sign visibility wouldn't have helped him get off. Thin blue line is real.,C
Fuck the police. Fucking pigs,L
"I could've ended up in a very similar situation a few years ago.  A cop in a Tahoe went straight through a stop sign going like 45 or faster in 25 zone.  It was like 1 in the morning and nobody else was on the road and he didn't have any emergency lights on.  He would have T-boned me very badly in my shitty little Saturn, and it would have been my side of the car.  I gunned it straight forward though when I saw him driving at me, If I would've turned left like I needed to then he would have smashed into me.  He just slowed down and kept on driving, probably feeling just as freaked out as I was.",C
"If you ever want to get away with breaking the law, just join a police force.",L
"As a police officer, he should get an even stricter sentence than a regular person, both because it was his job to be well-aware of the laws in place, and because in his job he serves to maintain the public trust and safety.",L
"edit: If you're mad about this, remember that State Attorney's get elected like everyone else.",L
US police continue to be the worst police in the western world.,C
"The US police force is corrupt through and through. Dont get me wrong there are good people who work in these departments. But when push comes to shove the institution and structure of police, litigators and justice system force 'good people' to make a 'one-time' compromise of their values, Every. Single. Time.",C
"""Stop sign was blocked by a low hanging Palm trees""",C
Sounds to me like prosecutors grasping at any excuse not to prosecute.,L
Don't complain when people don't trust the cops anymore. This is one of many examples of police being above the law.,C
At least we can be thankful they didn’t charge the teen with resisting arrest or some other bullshit charge that deflects the blame from themselves.,C
Our institutions have Stage IV Cancer,C
"Kind of reminds me of Felix Coss, a 61 year old teacher ran over while walking across the street in a crosswalk with the walk-signal by officer Paula Medrano who witnesses say was looking at her cellphone. The city argued that the teacher assumed the dangers of crossing the street so it was his own fault:",L
"Plantiff(s) voluntarily performed and engaged in the alleged activity and assumed the risk of the injuries and/or damages claimed. Plaintiff(s) failed to use all required, proper, appropriate and reasonable safety devices and/or equipment and failed to take all proper, appropriate and reasonable steps to assure his/her/their safety … Plaintiff(s)’ implied assumption of risk caused or contributed, in whole or in part [sic] to his/her/their injuries.",C
"Officer Paula Medrano is still on the force, didn't even get a ticket.",L

This happens often.,L
Hardest job everybody,L
I hate that culture that's been been prevalent for so long where it's them on one side and us in the other... And it's law enforcement that has made it that way. I have no respect for cops and don't get that narc mentality. Sorry but if I see a cop in need I'm not helping.,C
"Judge for yourself, I believe this is the intersection based on the address specified in this article:https://cbs12.com/news/local/police-off-duty-pbso-deputy-ran-stop-sign-before-crash-in-delray-beach",L

Why the downvote?  I think people want some context of where the accident happened?  It is street view so some things may be a little different but the street there is pretty narrow to be going 50+ mph.,L
Oh but hes a hero! Whatever will we doo without someone to protect us? Let him walk! Let him walk/s,L
Yikes.  Fucking PBSO needs to check itself,C
Worst part is that the person who caused the accident doesn't even have to pay for her medical bills.,L
"I ran a stop sign for the same reason and was told that "" ignorance of rhe law is no excuse"" even though I had never been there before",C
"Yeah so I got put on probation in Palm Beach County and its way too conservative there, I moved to california because they don't extradite for misdemeanors. Florida law enforcement is a nightmare.",L
What happened to “ignorance of the law is not an excuse for breaking it”,L
"This is totally fucking crazy. If he was off duty though, I assume it means the family can sue him personally instead of the department. And they’ll win.",C
fuck this dude. i lost my job because of a reckless. fuck him he should go to jail for a long time. this is one of the reasons people say fuck the police and have no respect for them and they wonder why.,L
how the fuck does this happen?,L
"I'm curious what the civil lawsuit situation is, both theoretical and actual.  Also, would the cop be able to use his union for defense in civil suit if the incident is off duty?",C
stop sign was obscured by a low hanging branch. No one going the limit or above would have seen it.,L
"Yeah... I wish "" sorry officer, I didn't see the stop sign."" Worked. Besides, isn't it a LIMIT? like your not supposed to go ABOVE that?",C
This is fucking bullshit... she was a nice girl... now she's all fucked up... I heard the dude had like 8 people in his truck and nobody breathalyze him.,C
watch this happen to one of my kids and I'd put that mfr in a coma,L
Had the roles been reversed charges would've been brought up.,C
Such a pathetic argument by the prosecutor.,L
Wonder if she would’ve been in a coma if you ran the sign at 25mph instead of 53mph you fucking bastard.,L
Is this what they mean by BlueLivesMatter?,C
Prosecutors said Thursday the stop sign was blocked by a low-hanging tree and drivers traveling at or above the speed limit would not have seen it.,C
Oh. How fucking convenient.,L
